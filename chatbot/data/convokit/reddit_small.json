He would pull his pants down to his knee, and then not hold his dick with his hand, instead he would just put both hands on his hips and kind of thrust his pelvis toward the urinal so that he was closer. \n\nSo me and other boys would make fun of him by pretending to do that pose he did. He then told our teacher what we did, and what exactly we were making fun of. This was a female teacher, and he was telling her how he stands when he pees and how we are mean for making fun of that.

Please read up on the anti-discrimination laws there along with the court's ruling as to why it construed discrimination.", "reply": "&gt;Why is it fine to teach religion to children but not about sexuality (age appropriate, of course)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell i wouldnt be mad if religious education got removed (Besides we haven't taught religious education to kids since it was removed some time ago). And i definetly will be wary of those who insist that their religion should be taught to kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway teaching religious education is not the same as teaching homosexuality.\n\nWe are not telling kids its okay to be of religion X or religion Y, or that such people exist. It has to do with cultural awareness, so that kids who grow up to be adults learn how to conduct themselves among the different religious people, be aware of their sensitives etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is absolutely no need to introduce homosexuality to kids, why should we confuse kids about their sexuality at such an age? Let them grow and figure it out for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And Tango Make Three is a very good example of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would put more responsibility on the parents to ensure they vet through the books before allowing the children to borrow them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, nlb didnt remove it, they moved it to the adult section under the directions of a minister. They are a public library funded by taxpayers. Public policy have to reflect a certain level of majority will. If the majority of people believe in traditional family values and do not think exposure to homosexuality is age-appropriate for children, then thats how public institutions are going to act.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You do realize that sex ed is taught at around the age of 15, right? It's certainly not taught to children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The idea that teens (on the cusp of adulthood) should not be taught actual facts about sexuality just because you disagree with it is ludicrous. For someone who's a libertarian, I have no idea how you can even support active educational censorship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm isnt there some sex education at primary? Anyway teens around the age of 15 are children too. Their parents still have a right to not expose them to homosexuality education, especially when there is no need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEhh i said i was a Libertarian on that issue, not in all. Even then a libertarian would rather a parent have some control over their kid\u2019s education than a gov forcing knowledge on their children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFunny how your brand it as censorship of facts. There are certain things that are appropriate to teach to children and some are not. We don\u2019t teach about the facts of open relationships, polygamy or masturbation. Is it censorship then?\n\nI can flip it around and see your insistence as a promotion of homosexual culture and lifestyle to kids. A libertarian certainly would want that forced into his kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It's a wedding cake. There are two types of weddings. It's not really hard to be honest about it.\n\nHe makes cakes for various ceremonies and occassions. He had denied other requests before, Halloween, divorce celebrations, bachelor\u00a0parties etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How would they purposefully seek it out if it's not advertised?\n\nBecause he is known for refusing to participate in events that conflict with his religious views\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That's a silly argument, because this business opened in the US that has the Federal Civil Rights Act. If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can cite anti-discrimination laws until you are blue in the face, it doesn\u2019t matter, it wasn\u2019t discrimination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nobody was denied service based on their identity!!!**. The gay couple could have asked for a cake for their birthday, they would have got it. A straight couple could have asked a wedding cake for their friends gay wedding, they would be denied. So how can you pin discrimination on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know whats funny, there was another case brought in front of the Col Commission, William jack vs azucar bakery. He wanted the bakery to write the quote \u201cHomosexuality is a detestable sin\u201d on a cake, but he was denied. He then sued but lost, the commission found that the bakery did not discriminate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo refusing to write biblical verses on the cake? Not discrimination. Refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding? Discrimination!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fuck?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould that  bakery have acceded? Of course not. i support the commissions stance in this instance, the business has a right to refuse to create a specific cake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"}

{"listen": "So I've lived in Singapore most of my life but my family never became Permanent Residents. After graduating high school I went abroad for college, and I'd visit my family on short-term passes most summer/winter breaks.\n\nSo I spent a few weeks back in Singapore this summer before going to Hong Kong to visit a friend for a week. After that I came back here since school doesn't start until later this month. When I got to immigration the lady was immediately unfriendly, but I've encountered my fair share of unfriendly airport agents and everything usually turned out fine.\n\nShe asked me the same sorta questions I usually got, but any time I misunderstood a question or she couldn't hear me or something she'd raise her voice or give me a rude response. I hadn't even done anything but she seemed generally pissed for whatever reason. Since it was like 2am and I was tired, I tried to be polite so I could move on and get home as soon as possible.\n\nI took out my phone to check the time, and when I turned it off it made a click sound (just like all iPhones do), and when the lady heard it her demeanor suddenly flipped. She accused me of taking a photo (even though I didn't) and demanded I delete it. I showed her the Photo app on my phone so she could see there wasn't a photo of her, then she just grabbed my phone and went through it herself. When she gave it back I even showed her how the click was just from the phone turning off, but she completely ignored me.\n\nFrom there her behavior just got so much worse, and her questions more accusatory. She noticed I was just in Singapore last week and asked what I was doing back so soon. I told her it was because my family lives here. I even had a return ticket for when I go back to school. She told me I needed to go to the office to get a secondary inspection (aka I was being detained). She didn't move and I didn't know where to go so I asked if I should follow her, and she yelled back \"How else are you supposed to get there if you don't follow me?\"\n\nThen when we were passing by all the other travelers waiting in line at immigration, she yelled out \"If you go traveling, don't throw tantrums\" for everyone to hear. I don't get why she had to humiliate me like that. By \"tantrums\" I assume she was referring to the imaginary photo I took of her so that I could later shame her on social media or whatever.\n\nAnyway, she took me to another counter. I was getting pretty nervous so I started tapping my fingers against the counter, and the male agent gave me a hard look and in a harsh tone he told me to stop. At this point I was worried all the agents would treat me like some sort of suspicious criminal, but thankfully the actual agents that did my secondary inspection were much more polite. They asked me some questions, then asked for my mom's EP details and phone number so that they can contact her to confirm the answers I gave them (our address, my status as a student, even the fact that she was my mom, etc). They took me to a waiting room while they called my mom, and eventually they came back in and told me I was free to go with a 30-day pass. I asked them if I was in any trouble. They told me I wasn't and that this was just normal immigration protocol, even though nothing about it felt remotely normal.\n\nAfter the whole experience I just felt really dehumanized. I used to think of Singapore as my home but now it feels like I'm not even allowed here. I'm Filipino, which I know is kind of a red flag but I figured since I used to live here and even have family living here that I wouldn't have any issues.\n\nI still plan on visiting my family in the future (likely twice a year), but I'm worried about this whole situation affecting my travel plans. Will I be flagged as a suspicious person whenever I come back? I'm wondering if the immigration agent could've even flagged me as \"difficult\" or \"insubordinate\" or something. I'm just scared about having a bad mark on my record and going through this whole thing all over again.", "reply": "did you get a name? definitely would complain her. do it the singaporean way"}

I think we're fully capable of some of them. When we think about Singapore economically, in my view there are two main things we have to consider: the first of which is that our biggest source of revenue is petroleum refinery, and the second of which is that it is truly our people who are our greatest economic asset. \n\nAs such the only policy I would agree with you on is that blanket bans on immigration is a *very* bad idea.  Singapore takes an economically traditional liberal perspective in terms of workers rights and working conditions. When we speak of shorter working hours, it's not that it's not possible, but that we think that the only way to make it happen is to reduce output and quality. I don't quite agree. Some forms of production require a set number of hours - think something along the lines of baking bread. You can't rush that. But for other things, especially corporate work, it really depends on the productivity and efficiency of each individual worker. This for me is where communist competition comes in. If you're not competing for favour and wages, you're collaborating on work that needs to be done. I would argue that a system in which workers receive better working conditions and shorter hours which are not as stupidly toxic and cutthroat in the way we see them now, would be much more conducive to effective and efficient work. A supportive work environment would help people feel supported and not alone, and therefore also increase retention, willingness to work, and job fulfilment. This isn't anything revolutionary, it's just management 101 stretched further.\n\nThen we get to social security vs lower taxes. This is one or the other, really. Personally I'm on the side of social security. How many of us know and ailing grandparent who needs a lot of medical attention and physical, mental, and emotional labour to take care of? How many of us have medical bills every month that aren't small? So on and so forth. There is a huge volume of people who require medical attention, but who don't do it because of the cost. The government subsides a sizeable amount, but it's still fairly expensive, especially on low incomes. Let's take another look at our taxes: 25% to CPF, x% for income tax, where x is anywhere between 0 and ~22%. We actually don't have very low taxes. It's entirely possible to fund a social security programme that encompasses healthcare, education, and retirement benefits. I think under those circumstances, raising taxes by an additional 5% is not a crazy idea. But wait, you say. What about housing? Well, under the circumstances of not having to pay for healthcare and education, housing becomes a lot more affordable. Stack that on top of progressive workplaces, and honestly housing becomes the only real cost you have left besides basic living like food and electricity.\n\nThen let's talk about freedom of speech. I hope you realise that a lot of our problems come from the presence of and lack of freedom of speech. It's not a monolithic thing that protects the peace in the country, it's something that is applied unevenly. Being unable, for example, to screen movies and media materials that do not showcase homosexuality and transgenderism as inherently negative things raises social stigma and discrimination against already vulnerable populations. Being able to get away with the above also means that the cycle of negativity continues. It's not just that some people don't have voices, it's that the people who do aren't policed for the terrible things they do or say. When was the last time we heard of someone being punished for discriminating against a gay person? I haven't. When was the last time we heard of someone being punished for insulting Christians? Amos Yee. The application of the laws, because they assume neutrality, is fundamentally going to be balanced towards those who have more social, political, and economic capital. So if we're not going to protect our vulnerable populations, who will?\n\nSo now going back to my two initial points: what are Singapore's greatest assets? I think it's in education. I think we need to relook our education system and means of testing, to redefine what it means to have a Singaporean education, to train our citizens to think, be critical, be innovative. We can't have that while suppressing freedom of speech. It's also hard to have that while worrying about living concerns. I think we can afford to implement policies that cost money and policies that will change the direction of Singapore, because we can't afford not to. The world is changing and we have to secure our place in it, and we're not going to do that by stagnating in these respects. We like making small tweaks, but once in a while having the courage to make the leap is necessary. I think this is necessary because it sets the stage for our further development in the 21st century, because we as a population are getting jaded earlier, exhausted sooner, and more mentally troubled.

Cerebral palsy is pretty bad, I think everyone would agree the world would be a better place if we eradicated that. But what about a citrus allergy?

It's more a defining trait of anyone with a phone.\n\nI've talked to a lot of people (as recently as a few days ago) whose impression of Singaporeans is about how they complain too much (on the internet), and I usually counter it with \"how is that any different from whiny comments on popular news articles in your country?\" As a foreigner myself, I find the social media comments from my home country (India) in news posts way worse than what I see here in Singapore. The sheer amount of pettiness, whininess, stupidity and negativity is staggering. And in multiple languages too.\n\nThat said, what with the comments from Nas Daily, and how Singaporeans are getting a lot of flak for being whiny in the comments, is the \"whiny Singaporean\" perception really accurate? Local Singaporeans who haven't lived outside (traveling doesn't really count, imho) would definitely say it's true, but as with any local population with limited exposure to bread-and-butter issues of other countries, it's easy to assume any common behaviour as uniquely Singaporean.\n\nSingaporeans who live overseas though, what do you think?\n\nEdit: sorry, my wording is a little confusing.

", "reply": "Feminism has throughout its history sought to control gender discourse through the social and political sphere. It did just that in the 70s by introducing the narrative that domestic violence is men seeking to control and oppress women - otherwise known as the Duluth model. When it was found out that women were violent towards men in almost equal numbers and that DV was mostly a two-way street, feminists stonewalled attempts to set up men's shelters, something that was already being done for women. Controlling gender discourse allows feminists to secure government funding for their various programmes and thus their source of income.\n\nA feminist organisation, in fact the largest one in the US, the National Organisation for Women, gave a woman (emma sulkowicz) an award for falsely accusing her male friend of rape.\n\nMary Koss, a prominent feminist and university professor, who has published numerous studies on rape and deliberately exaggerated numbers, was consulted by the FBI for dealing with rape, said that men cannot be raped. Here is the [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/889-wers/male-rape).\n\nHere is the extract from the interview I linked:\n\nTheresa Phung: \"So I am actually speaking to someone right now. his story is that he was drugged, he was unconscious and when he awoke a woman was on top of him with his penis inserted inside her vagina, and for him that was traumatizing.\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"Yeah.\"\n\nTheresa Phung: \"If he was drugged what would that be called?\"\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"What would I call it? I would call it 'unwanted contact'.\"\n\nTheresa Phung: \"Just 'unwanted contact' period?\"\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"Yeah.\"\n\nFeminism claims to be a lot of nice things. That's on paper. That's in the dictionary. The truth is far from that.\n\n&gt;Not one at the expense of another. That's what I feel feminism is\n\nYou may feel that's what feminism is, maybe from reading feminist websites or listening to feminist propaganda, but in reality that's what feminism has gone against."}

{"listen": "Mandatory this happened a few weeks ago. \n\nI was alone at my dad's in the evening and he'd just gotten these fancy new, very very sharp Japanese knives. He specifically told me not to touch them because they were sharp. I think I may be selectively deaf.\n\nAt around 11pm I decided to go upstairs and watch some YouTube videos in bed. But I suddenly heard a sound from upstairs. My brain went into full fight-mode, as in ANY SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT WILL BE TREATED AS DANGER. My imagination completely took over and I grabbed the largest fucking Japanese knife I could find. \n\nI was the definition of stealth. I was danger. That burglar would never see me coming. I tip-toed up the stairs, holding the knive in an upwards position. My brain was convinced the burglar was in the bathroom (because where else would he be?) so I repositioned the knife for attack-mode. \n\nWell, that was a mistake. You know, apparently those Japanese knives are not meant to be lightly thrown in the air and then caught like a spear. I dropped the knife after feeling it slide through my flesh like butter and searched for the lights, subsequently running into the doorframe. I cleaned up the blood in my bubble of shame. I was definitely the worst ninja ever.\n\nI now have a scar on my palm of which I will never tell the story to anyone I know. I am 21 years old. I have now retired from nightly knife-wielding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have a vivid imagination and thought there was a burglar in my bathroom. I am very stupid. I should not touch knives.\n\nEdit: I feel like I should clarify the \"lightly throwing in the air\" part. Do you know when you want to reposition something in your hand because it's not ideal? I kinda flicked it in the air and the end of the blade went into my hand. I tried to hold it like a serial killer.\n\nAlso, thank you for appreciating my impeccable knife skills.\n\nEdit 2: The sound was probably just the house creaking.

{"listen": "Hello!\n\nLast Wednesday I cleared out the freezer. My shitty ex-roommates had left 18 pounds of cheap meat in there, and I was so preoccupied by my thoughts of \u201cwho the fuck even does that\u201d that it wasn\u2019t until after it was all in the bottom of the can that it occurred to me that the trash had just come the day before. \n\nHm. Well, the lid will be closed. It\u2019ll be fine. Right?\n\nOn Friday, I exited the house and was greeted by several dozen flies. Ah. I\u2019ve fucked up. This is immediately apparent to me. Well, it\u2019ll just have to wait until trash day.\n\nSaturday. I need to take the kitchen trash out. I leave it outside, figuring that I can just wait until after the can has been cleared. \n\nSunday. Raccoons have been in my bagged garbage. I need to take care of that. Hesitantly, I open the can lid. Oooooooh boy. In a split second, I get the immediate impression that there are hundreds of maggots in the can. I\u2019m short\u2014just barely 5\u20193\u201d, So this was based entirely on the ones I could see far up the sides of the can. But I\u2019m fairly tough, I think. I\u2019ve pulled maggots out of a baby skunk\u2019s leg wound before. And I\u2019m  a budding baby biologist. I can handle this. So I throw the bag into the can.\n\nI am now sure there are at least 1000 maggots in the can. \n\nMonday. Otherwise known as today. I gear up. Poison, rubber gloves, eye protecting glasses, a face mask, and a box of moth balls. I can do this. I\u2019m a scientist. I throw open the lid. It had not occurred to me that they might be on the underside of the lid.\n\nThere were at LEAST a thousand maggots JUST on the underside of the lid. These rained down everywhere, their hideous bodies plopping onto the ground. I thank my lucky stars none got on me. I screamed like I was being murdered, an entirely involuntary sound wrenched from somewhere deep in my spine. I sprayed. And I sprayed, and I sprayed. I walked around and sprayed the writhing layer of maggots on the underside of the lid. I sprayed at the ground. A fly flew at my face and I gave up, running back inside, sobbing. \n\nFor a while, I watched from my back window as they crawled around on the can and the ground. I called my mom, who laughed at me. I called my dad, who was seven hours away and couldn\u2019t help. I called my boyfriend, who was five hours away and without a car. I\u2019m here for school; I have friends, but none good enough to help me with something like this.\n\nAnd it\u2019s Labor Day. I called eight different pest control places until I found one that was both open and able to send someone out. I\u2019m currently awaiting my savior, who should be here in a few hours. I\u2019ll update with the cost of him coming out. \n\nTL;DR: grew maggots in 100\u00b0 weather for a week, made it rain when I tried to take care of it. Now scarred for life. \n\nOn the bright side, I now know for a fact that as much as I enjoy learning about bees and ants, I should not apply to that entomology master\u2019s degree program I was looking at. \n\nEdit: the bug man came, he was super sweet, really excellent. If anyone in the Round Rock/Austin area needs pest control services, PM me, I\u2019d be very happy to pass his info on. He didn\u2019t charge me, said I reminded him of his daughter, so I gave him the money I had set aside for a tip. \n\nAlso: I threw out the meat because I didn\u2019t know if it was safe or not. I have no idea when it was frozen, most of it was unlabeled, and I have no way of knowing how long they waited between buying the meat and freezing it. If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at my ex roommates for buying and failing to eat 18 pounds of meat before moving across the country.", "reply": "Never had such a large infestation as that...\n\nBut usually have the trash emptied, then either fill the can with water and tip it, or lay it on the side and give ot a good thorough rinsing.

(If you're careful and have a good sized funel, you can put the bleach back in the bottle and dispose of without diluting with water.) Give the can one final rinse, and you good son. \n\nSeriously, drown 'em, dump 'em, bleach 'em. Nasty but pretty cheap to fix, compared to hiring a guy to come out and spray posion...

So I have had trouble sleeping and I am in high school so it takes a large toll on me.\n\nI woke up this morning after 4 hours of sleep, and I have a maths test today and I am struggling to stay awake as is. So on my walk to school I figured I would stop by Woolies and buy an energy drink. Walked in, saw that they were on special so my dumb arse bought 4.\n\nAlmost at school now and I have downed 3 of them and I down another one om my way in. (Now I usually have these but not in such a large dosage).\n\nI get in to class and my teacher doesnt mind me having a can in class so I drink away. About half an hour into class and I can't sit still. My legs and hands are shaking uncontrollably and my heart is racing. I panic a bit and don't really know what to do so I just sit there and take the test.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes and I am sitting on the toilet writing this, with 2L of V Energy in my gut. Even better thing is that I looked at the can and worked out how much caffeine I had consumed... 620mG of caffeine in under 2 hours.\n\nSo I am just gonna pray I don't have a heart attack or something. At least I won't fall asleep in class though haha.\n\nTL;DR: Had hardly any sleep. Bought energy drinks to stay awake during a test. Had 2 Liters of V Energy and now I am shaking like a leaf. Will update at the end of the day to see how I go. \n\nEDIT: I survived the day. Started coming down from all that caffeine after about 4 hours. I felt so shitty and just wanted to sleep it off. My resting heart rate was 160Bpm and I felt really sick. Lost my appetite too. But hey I stayed awake during my test so mission accomplished. :)", "reply": "Did you survive?"}

{"listen": "To begin, I'm a female BDSM practitioner. I enjoy it, and I won't apologize. (Edit: That came out harsh. I'm Sorry)\n\nMy husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. \n\nSo we get into it, and he's spanking me and I'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. Hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch \"Ma'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight.\" \n\n\"Did you call 911???\" My husband asked, \"tell them it was an accident!!\"\n\nSo I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says \"we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.\n\nI said okay thank you, and I hung up.\n\n\"The police are coming.\"\n\nShit. I'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. Within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. We put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.\n\nI calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn't mention the spanking.\n\nApparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. \"He told you about our contract?\"\n\n\"He felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show State of Mind.\"\n\nI go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we're going to do that again.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy BDSM session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.\n\nEdit: iWatch doesn't exist. &lt;3\n\nEdit: this post is not Deja Vu. Yes. I posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. The literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. They took it down because this happened on Wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.\n\nEDIT: Holy shit.

{"listen": "Alright. I saw the story about the handcuffs so I thought I would tell my story.\n\nSo both my girlfriend and I are deaf. Well, partially deaf. We both met in a special school and have been dating for about 5 years, in case you were wondering how deaf people met. What is also special about our relationship is that she is from France and I'm American--so there is also a language barrier added to our dynamic.\n\n\nSometimes, she will go visit her family in France. And when she comes back, there is often a sexfest that occurs. It was great in college, its great as a young adult. We usually keep it tame but I have always told my neighbors that if we are loud for any reason, to just ring the doorbell. I also don't know if people know this but instead of having an audible noise from our doorbell, the light flickers. \n\n\nIts the day that she is coming home and I'm excited. Everything is set up, candles, romantic shit. Events are partaking, everything is going great but then we start incorporating some interesting shit. We would usually do shower stuff, flexible position shit or food stuff (don't ask). But this time, we were doing BDSM shit. There was some yelling, some moaning. Some answering the door partially naked and hoping the Postmates guy wouldn't be judgemental (even though they always are).\n\n\nShe puts on a facemask and handcuffs me to the bed. Which in hindsight, is pretty weird shit for people who cannot hear very well. But I was down. \n\n\nShe lifts the eye mask and says she'll be right back. So I'm just chilling blindfolded, handcuffed and rocking a boner. Pretty sure there is a Wedding Crashers scene about my situation. A couple of minutes goes by and she hasn't come back yet. *Was she finally going to do the special cosplay we talked about? Was she on the toilet. Was she eating?* A lot of thoughts. \n\n\nA couple more minutes goes by and now I'm a little bit worried. Excited, but nervous. I start calling her name and don't get any response....\n\n\nI start to try to wiggle my way out of the handcuffs but it doesn't work. I'm just waiting for some type of reaction and hopefully that everything is alright. I begin to feel the ground shaking, which sounded like footsteps and I thought, *Another person? Fuck yeah.* So now I'm back to a stiffy. \n\nSuddenly, the blindfold lifts and there are four police offers starting at me. This is the fucked up thing, my fantasy was police officer sex. I thought she was playing into it because she was still naked. The officers aren't really saying anything, there are three cute female officers and a young looking male officer. We had done swinger parties in the past so I wasn't surprised by anything that was going on. \n\n\nIts not been a solid 30 seconds and nothing has happened. Just a staring fest. They begin to speak but I cannot understand. I now know that shit is going on and ask to be removed from the handcuffs and now put on some pants. I tell them our story and they slowly begin to understand. There now writing things down and tell us that they were doing a well-being check for our neighbor and heard us. They knocked on the door but now they get why they couldn't hear us. (Normally, they would know if we were hearing impaired through a bio they would have but since they weren't searching for us in the beginning, they wouldn't know what was going on). I proceed to walk out of the room and see the damage, including a busted down door, four of our neighbors on the floor peaking into our condo and a cake on the floor. \n\n\nSo TL;DR Had rough sex, am deaf, cops heard it, we couldn't.

{"listen": "I'll start by saying I have a wife and two kids, and I live really far away from my mom and dad. It's been a few years since I've seen them before today, and so last month my wife made a suggestion that we take a trip down to their house for a surprise visit, which is about 3,000 miles away (we all live in the united states.)\n\nI was all for the idea, so we planned accordingly. Fast forward about 30 days and finally, we arrived yesterday night at a friends house 20 minutes from my parent's house. At this point they still didn't know we were in their home state. We had our friend text my parents that night to ask them if they could drive down to a restaurant next to their house at 8 o'clock in the morning to meet up with him for breakfast, and they agreed. By the way, he made sure not to mention us in the text.\n\n*So from my parent's point of view, a family friend asked them to meet up for breakfast, and my parents were like, \"sure.\"*\n\nSo my friend, my wife and I all go to the restaurant as soon as it opened while my friends wife watched our kids, because they were still sleeping. We were planning on staying an entire week anyway so we figured if the kids could see their grandparents after the surprise breakfast, it would be fine.\n\nWe were at the restaurant for an hour when my parents finally showed up (on time). My wife and I were excited as we've put allot of time and money into this, so we jumped out of our chairs when we saw them walking in. My mom started crying and my dad looked happier than ever. We all caught up while eating breakfast and everything was flowing smoothly. That is, until the check came. My wife and I planned on paying, but then my parents insisted on it. With my dad being Italian, he was very stern and insisted he would pay for the breakfast. My wife told me to let them take care of it, but I wouldn't back down.\n\nThis dragged on for what seemed like an eternity, and my wife and I got into a miniature argument about it. Everyone was talking and there was allot of tension throughout our table. I heard my dad make a serious-toned comment saying \"You two should have never got married.\" I looked at him and stood up from the table, and said \"What the F*ck? Come on! We are trying to get along here!\"\n\nI felt like I was a teenager back at home and under my parent's control. Anyway, he stood up and threatened to fight me so I immediately punched him in the dick. He dropped. I don't remember what exactly happened after that, but my friend drove me and my wife back to their house. Since then I've cooled down, realized I made a huge mistake, and have been trying reaching out to my parents in several ways. They will not respond to me. I don't even know why I punched him there, but it didn't feel inappropriate at the time because I have been practicing Krav Maga for a few months now.\n\nI feel super bad and wish I could turn back time. I can't help but think that in my parent's world, their son from across the country all of a sudden showed up to their hometown and pretty much immediately punched dad in the dick. I can't even believe I am writing this post on reddit right now.\n\n**tldr**: TIFU by punching my dad in the dick for threatening to fight me after surprising him in a restaurant.\n\n", "reply": "Sounds like there is a lot of unresolved issues from when you were a teen."}

{"listen": "So today I was hanging out at my neighbors house just talking and getting to know each other. They're pretty chill and I really felt like this would lead to a great friendship.\n\nAfter a couple hours of banter I started feeling my gate to the nether weakening and I knew it was time to go make a deposit into the toilet so I politely asked to go to the bathroom, a completely normal thing to do right?\n\nThey informed me that the light in there was broken so I was just like whatever I'll use my phone as a flashlight to make sure no brown substances were remaining on my crevice.\n\nI go in there and Im just going through the routine, browsing reddit, trying to make my bowel movements quiet as possible, yall know the drill. However once I reached the wiping phase, my life changed.\n\nI commenced the first wipe like usual, checked it out with the light, I knew I'd definitely need to do some more rounds. After a few wipes, the scariest moment of my life occured.\n\nMy flashlight lit up the toilet paper and what I saw made me feel fear unimaginable by the human psyche until felt firsthand. I saw a black snake like creature wrapped around my hand, and my brain immediately thought I was infected with some kinda anal superworm.\n\nI let out a bloodcurling shriek. One that you'd hear in the depths of hell. In my instinct driven spasm I somehow broke the toilet seat and my ass fell into the fucking toilet. I was in a primal state I can't even explain. I was desperately flaying my body around like a dying fish trying to find this ass demon but I couldn't find it anywhere.\n\nMy neighbors were extremely worried thinking I was dying of a heart attack/seizure/stroke in their bathroom, but I didn't give two shits. My inards were being harvested by some kinda alien species, why the fuck would I care what they think?\n\nAfter about 45 seconds of searching for the little shit I started coming to my senses. If there really was something living in my anus, where the fuck did it go? Then I looked down, and felt the worst embarrassment in my entire life.\n\nThe black, slithering, slimy, snake like worm wasn't a parasite, it was my hoodie string. I just destroyed my neighbor's toliet, screamed caveman like shouts, and threw my body around like a retarded octopus, over a fucking hoodie string.\n\nMy neighbor's concerned voice turned into a \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE???\" At this point and I was speechless. I tried to muster up some kind of explanation but I could only mutter \"Im...Im so...sor....sorry.\" I was scared to open the door, but I knew it had to be done.\n\nI opened it to see the faces of a family that won a free trip to a zoo, but got tricked into going to an insane asylum. They just stared at me. I just stared back while covered in shit water and a face of a man who survived the Holocaust.\n\nI didn't know what to say so I just muttered \"I'll see myself out.\" and they didn't even respond. I silently waddled out the door and walked to my house with a broken soul.\n\nI feel terrible. I broke their toilet and obviously need to compensate them for the damages, but I dont know if I can ever see them again without having horrible flashbacks. I truly am a lost man. I will never be the same.\n\nTL;DR I thought my hoodie string was a parasite from my anus and broke my neighbors toliet.", "reply": "Kind of similar story:\n\nMy 15yo sister got up from the toilet and was mortified, it was all red in there, bloodred. I can't even begin to imagine, what she must have thought in that instant, but she gathered some courage and went slowly, shaking, to mom, told her about it. Mom was rather calm, because my sis said that it wasn't red when she wiped, so there should be no reason to be afraid.\n\nLater that night, when dad went to sleep after working almost all day in the garage, mom told him about what happened.\n\nMy dad started laughing, because he poured a bucket full of beetroot juice in the toilet that day.

{"listen": "This actually happened over the summer, when I was studying abroad in Germany. Sometime mid July. I'll also be honest up-front, I don't have proof that this was an attempted abduction, because I got away at the end. It's nevertheless clear that there were sinister motivations, so the \"best\" possible situation was an attempted date rape.\n\nAt the end of the semester, I traveled around a bit with my (now ex) boyfriend, who was also in Germany for a summer job, but lived in a different city than me. One place I REALLY wanted to go was Trier, the oldest city in Germany, so he and I booked train tickets and planned to meet there for a weekend. Unfortunately, it turned out that Trier wasn't much of a destination (even though I thought it was super cool), so the only train my boyfriend could get would have him arrive at 1am on Friday night, whereas my train got into town at about 3 in the afternoon. No big deal, though, I figured just see some sights on my own and stay up to let him into the hotel when he got there. \n\nAt about 9pm on that Friday, I was done walking around but it was still light out (summertime) and the main square was still really hopping with people out for the evening, so I decided that I'd buy a beer from a grocery store (yes, I'm super cheap) and just sit on one of the benches in the square enjoying the atmosphere before heading back to the hotel for the night. So far, so good. \n\nI'm sitting in the square sipping my beer, and this maybe mid-30s guys starts chatting with me in English because he's Pakistani. This isn't so unusual, since the whole \"backpacking across Europe\" thing is still sort of a thing, so young travelers often chat with each other in my experience. I'm kind of uncomfortable at this point, but that's just because I'm an awkward introvert who hates talking to strangers. The whole time we're talking, I'm kind of thinking *\"wow, I can't wait for this conversation to end so I can go back to the hotel and Reddit\"*. \n\nOnce I finish my drink, though, he notices and asks if I'd like to go to a bar and get a drink. I'm a total homebody who doesn't do things like go to bars with strange men, so I decline, but eventually he persuades me to move to an outdoor table at a street-side cafe. *Ok,* I think, *I've got plenty of time before my boyfriend gets here. I'll have one soda pop and then excuse myself.*\n\nNope. As soon as the waitress comes over, before I can open my mouth, the guy orders two beers- one for each of us. Still, two drinks isn't much. I knew I could more than handle it, and I decided I'd accept the one drink, but no more (not to mention I don't like Pilsners, which is what he ordered. Hefe-Weizen for life.) We're chatting, and he asks if I'm alone in Trier or with friends, so I say that I'm with a \"friend\", meaning my boyfriend. He immediately follows with asking if this \"friend\" is male or female, and seems disappointed when I say male. (Yes, in hindsight I should have said \"boyfriend\", but remember that this boyfriend is now my *ex*, as mentioned above, and at this point we were already on course to break up, so it wasn't quite so cut-and-dry what we \"were\".) However, this may have been what saved me later.\n\nAfter we finish the beers, he starts complaining that the cafe isn't showing the world cup game, even though Germany was playing that night. I should have excused myself then, but he convinced me to move out of the main square to a side street and to sit down at another outdoor cafe where we can see a TV screen. Again, he immediately orders me a beer. \n\nNow I'm going into my third drink in less than an hour, which is more than I care to drink alone in a strange city with a strange man. When the waitress arrives and gives us our glasses, he immediately started saying that he was going to order us both shots as well! This is where I put my foot down... except he ignores that. Despite me saying \"no\" to the shots multiple times, he got up and went to find the waitress to order the shots, probably so that I *couldn't tell her that I didn't want one*. \n\nNow it's really clear that he's trying to get me drunk, and I really don't want to be drunk. Again, yes, hindsight is 20/20. I should have taken his absence from the table as my opportunity to disappear, but I'm an idiot. A lot of why I didn't leave is because he didn't really do anything \"wrong\", if that makes sense? He didn't make lewd comments or grab me or anything- the only \"wrong\" thing he was doing was being very persuasive and then ignoring my protests against more drinks. Otherwise, he was very friendly and polite, so out of a desire to also be polite, I stayed. Ladies: learn from my mistake, and DON'T STAY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS JUST TO BE POLITE. \n\nEven though I stayed at the table, I'm not a *complete* moron, so while I was alone, I dumped half of my beer into the potted plant next to me. I'm really not sure if he noticed, because he didn't say anything about it, but the plant was still fizzing when he returned... oops.\n\nNow we've got two shots in front of us and partially drunk beers. I finish both and run in to the bathroom (that's a 1.5liters in an hour and a half... I was bursting at the seams), only to return to find out he'd ordered us both another beer in my absence. This beer is now the 5th drink of the evening, and would put the volume of liquid at 2 liters. That's hella beer, and I was really struggling to even drink it. \n\nWhile I'm super slowly sipping my beer, the guy started getting phone calls every few minutes. Now, I mentioned he was Pakistani before because that's relevant now. I couldn't understand the calls because he was speaking Urdu on the phone, but it was clear that someone was impatient with him and wanted him to hurry up, especially since they kept calling back over and over. He said it was some friends asking him to come hang out. Eventually, he got tired of waiting for me to finish my beer (I was REALLY struggling to drink it), so he says \"forget the beer, let's go.\" He pays the tab and we start walking down the side street. \n\nNow it's about 10:30pm. It's dark. I decided to myself that one way or another, I would be gone and headed back to the hotel at 10:45. \n\nWhile we're walking through the streets of Trier, an older Pakistani man suddenly comes up to us. His uncle, apparently, who speaks no German or English. I shake his hand and greet him anyway, then the guy stepped in between me and his uncle, so that I couldn't see what they were doing... but I could hear the sound of paper money being exchanged and counted. Then the guy said \"thanks\", and we kept walking. \n\nAfter a little bit, we come to a hookah bar. The guy has been smoking cigarettes all evening, which is also pretty normal in Europe, but I have never smoked in my life and I don't want to start (I can't stand the smell), so I'd declined his offers of cigarettes. Now he's trying to persuade me to go into the hookah bar (where his \"friends\" who'd been calling him are) and smoke a hookah and have another drink. Nope. I glance at my watch, and it's 10:45, when I promised myself I'd leave no matter what. \n\nSo I begin to say that I couldn't *possibly* stay and smoke a hookah because my (boy)friend's train would be in at 11, and I said I'd be there to meet him (which is complete BS- he wouldn't arrive for another two hours). I'm super clear that there's a man expecting me very shortly, which gets him to finally back off (weird how that works), then I quickly walk away. Once I'm around the corner, I broke into a run for a bit to make sure I wasn't being followed, then found my way back to the main square and then to my hotel, where I collapsed on my bed. Everything was swirling around me because of the booze, and the first thing my boyfriend said when he saw me 2 hours later was \"...are you drunk?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \\- I was an idiot and let a stranger get me drunk while I was alone at a bar in a foreign country, and he may have tried to sell me to a middle-aged man, but I ran away right before I walked into what was potentially a trap where his \"friends\" were waiting. *Never ever stay in a situation where you're uncomfortable just to be polite!*", "reply": "Was the sex trafficking a clickbait?

But we do other stuff, one of them is grinding on eachother.\n\nWe are on the beach and we find a nice spot at the end where the rocks form a little harbor and its pretty shallow. Theres nobody in sight, so we decide to start making out in the water, she gets on top of me and we start grinding, everything feels good but his is where the fuck up happens. We are both wearing bathing suits and *apparently* ocean water isnt a very good lubricant. After a while we decide its time to head back and we stop. As i get up i feel a sharp pain in my penis and a warmth in my pants. She screams because theres a small stain of blood on my pants. I look inside and see that my head is bleeding. The first thing i do is jump back into the water to \"disinfect it\" and let me tell you, that pain was the worst pain ive ever felt in my penis. I started tearing up. Shes screaming sorry from the shore as im trying not to drown and hoping the sharks have mercy on me.\n\nWe started swimming back to the boat and i had to pee. This was the second worst pain i felt. I thought i broke my urethra like a post here a few years ago. I was scarred shitless that i was going to loose my penis, and die a virgin.\n\nI didnt even want to look at my penis because i feared the worse. Every movement hurt. Every ounce of pee hurt. It was horrible\n\nLater that night i decided to inspect it. No broken urethra, but it looks like someone used 80 grit sandpaper on my head. It is dark red and sort of flattened out on the bottom left side.\n\nEvery step i take hurts. Every time i sit, it hurts, putting vaseline on it hurts, *looking* at it hurts! \n\nMy grandpas birthday was today so we all went to red lobster, everyone was asking why im walking weird and i said that its because i have a rash. Technically not lying.  \n\nI have no idea how long its going to take to heal. Im just going to have to go to college in basketball shorts and use boxers instead or briefs. Sleeping is also difficult. \n\nUpdate: its steadily healing! It doesnt hurt to walk or touch it directly anymore. The texture is like the surrounding skin again.

If were anywhere else, then ill try to dry it up with a napkin (i keep a bunch in my glove compartment) but ill let the rest dry.

{"listen": "LTL, FTP. Format is chaotic because I\u2019m on mobile. This happened today, etc etc. \n\nAfter a sleepless night that I can only chalk up to changing my sleeping schedule for my new job, and also because I wanted to watch Seinfeld more than I wanted to sleep. I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life. Oh, and I skipped breakfast because I\u2019m an idiot. At this point of morning I\u2019ve been awake for about 20 hours.\n\nI started my new job at a green grocer\u2019s a few days ago. It\u2019s a nice place, easygoing, solid clientele. The woman who is training me is 35 weeks pregnant and going on her maternity leave tomorrow. We\u2019ll call her \u2018S\u2019. All morning S is talking to me about how excited she is to finally have a couple of weeks to herself. No work, no baby, just her and her couch. S started talking about how the baby felt kinda odd today, and I\u2019m falling in and out of sleep while standing (about 28 hours awake at this rate) and start craving bacon and eggs. I\u2019m willing to give my life for bacon and eggs. That\u2019s unimportant, but I wanted to briefly talk about the last nice thing I thought about before chaos ensued. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about how to cash up and close the store when suddenly S says \n\u201coh\u201d, and then she says \u201coooOOOH\u201d. I\u2019m not properly registering anything at this rate and am facing the register so I figure she\u2019s bumped her knee or something. More casually than you should EVER ask a pregnant woman, I say \u201cyou all good?\u201d \n\nSilence. \n\n\u201cUh, yeah, I think I\u2019m okay. That was weird. Anyway, what you next have to do is - OH OH WHAT!\u201d S has put her hands on her stomach and finally my idiot dial clicks from \u2018oblivious moron\u2019 over to \u2018semi-aware dickhead\u2019. This lady is in labour. I\u2019m 23, and while I may be a woman myself I have no idea what the fuck to do so I start scrambling for the store owner who shouts \u201cCALL THE AMBULANCE, I\u2019LL CALL HER HUSBAND\u201d. The sudden yelling from the manager, the contraction screams in the background, the bacon and eggs, and the customers witnessing the scene all set off some abominable reaction in my brain and the next thing I know I\u2019m on the ground with the store\u2019s owner leaning over me and instructing an onlooker to call a second ambulance. \n\nAnyway, things are a bit hazy here. I end up in the hospital on a drip with a doctor asking me a million questions. Eventually I\u2019m released with one of those hospital sandwiches and a prescription to \u2018rest up\u2019. Finally I make my way home, eat my sandwich, take a nap, and am now preparing myself for the embarrassment I\u2019ll no doubt face when I walk in to my shift tomorrow. \n\nTL;DR: no sleep + no eat = passing out in the middle of your shift after realising that your coworker has gone in to labour. \n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t have any updates on S so if you feel like asking, I unfortunately can\u2019t help out right now. I just hope she\u2019s doing well! \n\nEdit: removed an unnecessary name. \n\nUPDATE: Currently on my break, and happy to report that S and her baby are okay! Baby arrived safely, and that\u2019s all of the info I have. \n\nUPDATE 2: holy hell I did not expect this to get any attention. \n\nQuick FAQ:\n\n1) This morning I finally managed to eat my bacon and eggs before work and didn\u2019t pass out today. The bacon and eggs were fucking amazing. Never skipping breakfast again. \n\n2) I live in Australia. Ambulance cover in my state costs $40 a year, so the ambulance ride was not expensive at all. Also, public healthcare is free under Medicare so the hospital stay, checkup, and sandwich were all free. Nice. \n\n3) Was Seinfeld worth this? Probably not, no. I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep regardless of if I was watching it but I definitely got a little too absorbed and it was 4am and my alarm was sounding before I knew it.

So something like a chicken thigh or a steak, 1/2 cup of rice cooked in low sodium stock or a potato, mashed, and some broccoli with garlic, red pepper, tossed with olive oil and roasted is a common dinner for me. I'll sometimes add some cheese to whatever.  I'll also frequently have a salad beforehand.\n\nI also make my own pizza dough from scratch with a 400g dough ball for a pizza .. it's a little too much for one, but I don't do it often.\n\nI make my own ice cream ... heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, frozen fruit macerated with sugar and lemon and lime juice.  The recipes that I use call for about 50% more sugar than I actually use.  I do that about once a month.   \n\nLunch is usually a salad from Chopt or a burrito from Chipotle.  Breakfast is a handful of jerky and a diet coke.  I also keep a bunch of nuts at my desk and buy bags of candy that I share.

{"listen": "So this all happened in June, and I\u2019m only writing about it now because the situation just got solved.\n\nAs the broke college student I am I found a website that offered me money for my notes about classes and old exams that I have taken, extremely simply procedure that consists of simply uploading PDFs on the web, categorizing them, and then getting a payment on my paypal. I think \u201cGreat! I make money and I can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones\u201d. \n\nThe fact that I scanned all my exams and kept them in my Google Drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. I upload 5 documents from my Organic Chemistry class and get paid $25, I figure that I might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?\n\nIn the span of a couple days I upload about 120 documents for subjects such as OChem, Physics, Calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials. I get a couple hundred bucks and go buy my, at the time, well deserved booze.\n\nFast forward a month, and I have just given all my finals, got my 4.0 this term and I am happily preparing to go back home. I wake up one morning with an email from my email professor informing me that due to the content I uploaded he is gonna fail me in the class even if I passed it with an A. \nI immediately panic, I start freaking out.\nTo make matters worse, I get an email from my Physics professor with the same exact content, failing the class even though I passed it.\n\nNow I am actually freaking the fuck out, I am an international student in the US so now I\u2019m scared my visa is gonna get cancelled and that I am a dead man.\n\nNext day I receive an email from the Director of Student Affairs asking to meet me to discuss the question. I\u2019m hoping he will just give me a slap on the wrist and tell me to not do it again. I meet him and after a two hour meeting he informs me that most likely I will be expelled from the school, not allowing me to enroll at the university I was transferring to and ultimately revoking my visa. I get home and have an absolute breakdown, I can\u2019t tell my parents because they will fucking disown me so I have this weight on my back that\u2019s literally killing me. \n\nHowever, the decision wasn\u2019t final so the Director asks to meet me again the next week. Every day that passes it becomes worse. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself. I have so much shit going one that I start having suicidal thoughts, I am at the lowest point of my life (I\u2019ve been lucky enough to never have experienced any real problems).\nThe day comes and the fucking Director tells me that he will not give me a final decision today and that he will contact me via email, due to the fact that I am leaving to go back to my home country and won\u2019t be in the States to personally see him.\n\nI fly back home, and after approximately three days I get an email informing me that I have been suspended for the summer term, I have a 2500 word paper about Academic Integrity and my GPA has been lowered to a 1.0 for the term. However, I will be able to transfer to the University I was planning to go and I will get to keep my academic scholarship. \nAdditionally, I have to write a paper of 2500 words about academic integrity that includes interview to two professors along with some other assignments that will be communicated me later.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and I am currently on a plane flying towards my new college, with a hue weight off my shoulders.\n\n\ntl;dr I uploaded old college exams on the internet, went from a 4.0 to a 1.0 for the term, nearly got expelled and deported. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that I had to remove all the documents I uploaded, only way to do so was refunding the company that paid me via PayPal. So overall, I didn\u2019t end up earning one cent.\n\nEDIT 2: Holy fuck this blew up way more than I expected.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting a lot of mixed reactions, people feeling bad for what happened (which they shouldn\u2019t) and people ripping my asshole apart (rightfully so).\n\nJust to specify a few things that I might have gone over too quickly. \nThe exams were semester old exams/weeks old, as I wanted to make sure nobody could benefit from the uploads as they would have been required to already take it.\nSecondly my GPA for the term was lowered to a 1.0, this impacted my overall GPA a tiny bit but I was still\nable to secure an academic scholarship at the university I transferred to.\n\nI didn\u2019t post it the TIFU with the purpose of saying \u201cFuck my College they are a bunch of douchebags\u201d, it was more with the intent to show how little, at the time meaningless, actions can fuck up your future, big time.\nEspecially because I just assumed I would be able to do in the US things that I used to do in high school back at home.\n\nI am grateful to the school for the course of action they took, as I know that things could have been way way worse.\n\nYou live and you learn.\n", "reply": "Damn, people don\u2019t fuck around when it comes to plagiarism.

{"listen": "Alright guys. \n\nHere is a PSA and obligatory \u201cnot today\u201d note all wrapped up into one. This happened on Sunday, and I\u2019m still suffering. \n\nTL;DR at the end\n\nAlso this is on mobile, so if it looks like ass, that\u2019s why. Sorry.\n\nAnyways, Sunday night my friend, we will call him Greg, texted me. He said he\u2019s paranoid and super drunk, and this guy is walking around his house with a rifle. \nI offer to come to his house and take care of him. \nWe agree. \nI was already hanging with my coworker, we\u2019ll call him Kyle, and Kyle is a nice dude, so he agreed to come with me. \nWe drive over there. \n\nGreg is sitting on his living room floor, laughing hysterically at how cute his dogs are, the gun is propped by the door, and loud rap music is playing. Looks like he\u2019s been having a grand ole time. \n\nWe\u2019re all just ducking around, a bunch of 20 something\u2019s, and Greg shows the bottle of cheap liquor he\u2019s been sipping on for the last couple days. Just some 100 proof Vodka. \n\nHe offers me a sip, and I\u2019m like \u201cSure, one shot can\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\n*boy, was I fucking wrong.*\n\nIn three hours, I have consumed about 8-10 shots worth of vodka. I\u2019m not exactly sure how much, in all honesty, because I just started chugging from the bottle at the end. \n\nI\u2019m fully clothed in a jacuzzi full of bubbles, wearing Greg\u2019s motorcycle helmet ( Pic Included here: https://i.imgur.com/80zq9Jv.jpg ).\n\nThis is at 9:11 P.M.\n\nHere is where the fuck-up becomes evident. \n\nSo, I take Prozac and Elavil. \n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know (much like my blissfully unaware self at that time) you are **not supposed to mix alcohol and antidepressants.** \n\nMy medicine and the alcohol met in my bloodstream, and rather than being friends they decided to duke it the fuck out with brass knuckles and all. \n\nI\u2019m laughing and I fall out of the jacuzzi. Ouch, that hurt.\n\nSo I\u2019m crawling on the floor, white girl wasted and covered in bubbles. And here is where everything starts going in and out. \n\nI remember Kyle was holding me on the floor asking if I was okay.\n\nI\u2019m nodding my head yes, and then my leg starts shaking. It quits for a minute, and then the other one is twitching, and I\u2019m laying on my side and i feel this *gut wrenching pull in my muscles.* I\u2019m jerked into the fetal position, then my spine seems to decide it doesn\u2019t like that, and I\u2019m snapped the other way, my back arching as sharply as it could possibly be, and my arms are jerked backwards. \nI\u2019m convulsing on my friend\u2019s concrete floor, and then I vomit and stop shaking for a minute. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long this continues. I\u2019m fading in and out. \n\nKyle is holding my head off the ground and telling me to look at him, Greg is in stunned silence, staring at me as I\u2019m covered in my own stomach contents, and I begin to start the strange contortionist-like dance that is my body jerking itself in every way possible. \n\nI remember trying to crawl to the shower, as Kyle told me he needed to get the puke out of my hair. \nI\u2019m laying on the stonework floor of the shower, hot water raining down on me. Someone picking chunks of Taco Bell out of my hair. Everything smells like bile, vodka, and the 5 tacos I\u2019d eaten earlier that day. \n\nMy body twitches, and I\u2019m like \u201coh shit here it comes\u201d and I\u2019m fucking snapping back and forth, smashing my head, legs, arms, and any appendages I can against the wall of the shower, the shower bench, and anything within my vicinity. I vomit some more. I stop. The water is warm. It doesn\u2019t hurt for a minute. I black out. \n\nI\u2019m on the floor, and now I\u2019m covered in towels, and Kyle tells me I ripped off my shirt shortly after the shower ended. I\u2019m then wrapped in more towels so I\u2019m not just swinging titty around like a damn carousel, and then I\u2019m carried to Greg\u2019s bed where I proceed to vomit in a trash can and pass out. \n\nSeveral hours later I wake up. \n\nI shakily put my dry clothes back on, look at the time. \n\nIt\u2019s 5 a.m. \n\n\nI have to be at Calculus by 8.\n\n\n\u201cWell shit.\u201d\n\n\nSpend the next hour grabbing my stuff and shaking Kyle awake to see if he\u2019ll drive us home. \n\n\nI get home by 7:20, take a shower to hopefully rinse off the ungodly scent that has implanted itself into my very being. I get to class at 8:30 still faintly smelling of vomit. \n\n\nI\u2019m still drunk. I go through all of my classes, still drunk. Physics was definitely interesting. \n\n\nI go to work, and **that** is when my hangover decides to hit. \n\nI\u2019m fucking feverish, I feel like I\u2019m gonna puke, I\u2019m fucking*covered* in bruises, customers are asking stupid questions, and I wrote a bitchy passive aggressive note to my supervisor about how I\u2019m sick of her shit. \n\nNow she and I have the same shift today, and it\u2019s time to see if I get demoted or just lose my job altogether. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI drank in excess, and blacked out, had seizures from my meds mixing with it. Go to work hungover. Might lose my job. \n\n\nEDIT: \n\nYes, I am aware what I did was stupid. I appreciate your astute observations. \n\nAlso my supervisor called in today, so I trashed the note \ud83d\ude0e\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSo just some clarifying things. \n\nMy friends did the best they could. Seizures are terrifying, and they were more focused on keeping me alive than what would normally be the logical choice of calling an ambulance. \n\nSo please stop saying I need new friends, and please stop telling I\u2019m an idiot. I don\u2019t really see either of those being helpful. I\u2019m painfully aware of my mistakes. \n\nI hadn\u2019t eaten. I am 5\u20194 and weigh 145lbs. It was however many shots in about three hours. I would normally stop at three, but I guess drunk me was like \u201c*more*\u201d\n\nI will be talking to my doctor about it, but I\u2019m scared to. \n\nEdit 3:\nSome of you fuckers don\u2019t believe me, so here the few pics I have from the situation. Bruises, and the jacuzzi\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9zmj9A8/", "reply": "I myself take fluoxetine (Prosac) and have drunk alcohol many times without these issues. My main issue is being unable to stop once I start, as well as a craving to drink daily, which never happened before I was on it. As such I don't drink on it. I'm not saying 'it's safe to', you are advised not to. Not least as alcohol is a depressant so it is hard to become truely well, as well as alcohol increasing the risk of side effects such as stomach upset.\n\nWhat I am confused with is why you are taking fluoxetine as well as Amitriptyline. It is quite rare to be given two antidepressents, as they have the same effect. Normally you'd be given one of 'Fluoxetine, Citalopram or Sertraline' (the main SSRIs) the dose increased if there is too little effect, switched to another if you reach the highest dose without enough effect/the side effects are intolerable. Then switched to another class of antidepressant, an SNRI like venlafaxine, or an atypical one like Amitriptyline, and as a last resort a tricyclic antidepressant. You may also have a low dose antipsychotic added, like Olanzapine.\n\nIt is very rare to be given two antidepressants as I say. You are more likely to overdose on two moderate overdoses of two ADs, than one massive overdose of a single one, due to serotonin being raised in two different ways.\n\nThis reaction does sound like serotonin syndrome: hypereflexia, diarrhoea, raised body temperature (more here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms)\n\nI'm NOT saying 'alcohol is fine!', it is always best to avoid it on medications, I'm just dubious it was the only cause. More that you were teetering with these two meds, and alcohol pushed you over the edge.\n\nIf there is a major reaction with a commonly ingested substance and a medicine, it will be stated clearly. Here it says 'AVOID ALCOHOLIC DRINK' in bold letters on the sticker, or the doctor will say it. It won't be 'buried in the fine print'. Nearly all medicines will say 'avoid alcohol' in the information leaflet, not least to reduce the risk of litigation should something like this happen.\n\n(Forgive me for using generic names, I'm in the UK and am unfamiliar with American brand names)."}

Then switched to another class of antidepressant, an SNRI like venlafaxine, or an atypical one like Amitriptyline, and as a last resort a tricyclic antidepressant. You may also have a low dose antipsychotic added, like Olanzapine.\n\nIt is very rare to be given two antidepressants as I say. You are more likely to overdose on two moderate overdoses of two ADs, than one massive overdose of a single one, due to serotonin being raised in two different ways.\n\nThis reaction does sound like serotonin syndrome: hypereflexia, diarrhoea, raised body temperature (more here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms)\n\nI'm NOT saying 'alcohol is fine!', it is always best to avoid it on medications, I'm just dubious it was the only cause. More that you were teetering with these two meds, and alcohol pushed you over the edge.\n\nIf there is a major reaction with a commonly ingested substance and a medicine, it will be stated clearly. Here it says 'AVOID ALCOHOLIC DRINK' in bold letters on the sticker, or the doctor will say it. It won't be 'buried in the fine print'. Nearly all medicines will say 'avoid alcohol' in the information leaflet, not least to reduce the risk of litigation should something like this happen.\n\n(Forgive me for using generic names, I'm in the UK and am unfamiliar with American brand names).", "reply": "I\u2019m on welbutrin and remeron.

{"listen": "I posted this in r/casualuk yesterday and it went down pretty well, and a couple of posters convinced me to post it here. Apologies if this is overkill and you've already read it! And honestly, I don't know if it qualifies as a TIFU, so I am sure the mods will decide. Be gentle, mods...  Anyway, a very English break-in story is pasted below... \n  \nI may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. The detail is pretty accurate, cos I made notes immediately after the event, and I've tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!\n  \nOn the first day of moving into my new house back in April of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn't long before I deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. I initially thought that wasn't so bad, I like a smoke from time to time and having him next door could be useful. Even if I went back in time right now to warn myself, there's no way I could convey how wrong I was... \n  \nNow 2015 was otherwise known as the worst year of my life. It certainly wasn\u2019t what Back To The Future had let me to expect. \n  \nAfter losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my BBQ exploding on my birthday gathering, I was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. It was August, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months\u2026\n  \nI\u2019d been up late watching It Follows, and not being much of a horror fan, I was suitably creeped out. And slightly high. My girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am I went up there too.\n  \nIt\u2019s probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. The ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. It\u2019s one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy Sussex village.\n  \nI went to bed and was soon drifting off. About 15 minutes later I heard some banging. I didn\u2019t pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. So I started to go back to sleep. The next memory I have is of shouting. Lots of shouting. The bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.\n  \nI remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. I also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. I thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. This led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.\n  \nSo now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. Maybe five. Hard to tell, I didn't get to put my glasses on. My girlfriend is screaming, they\u2019re all shouting, and I\u2019m incredibly confused. The ringleader then demands that I give him the bag of money.\n  \n\u201cWhat money!?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\u201cGive us the fucking bag of money, we know you\u2019ve got the bag of money!\u201d the ringleader repeats. Several times.\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a bag of money,\u201d I explained. It\u2019s hard to remember the order of events, but I do know one thing for sure - Tom Cruise popped into my head.\n  \nThe previous night I was watching Mission: Impossible 3. I do like that film, and I had it on in the background while I did the washing up. I remember pondering the scene where Ethan Hunt\u2019s wife has a gun to her head. \u201cI want to give you what you want, but you\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right!\u201d exclaimed Hunt. Hmmm. I wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. Is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?\n  \nWell, it apparently sewed a seed, because I found myself repeating those words.\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a bag of money. I want to get you what you want, but you have to do what\u2019s right and leave this poor girl alone,\u201d are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.\n  \n\u201cYeah? Well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!\u201d said the one I considered to be the sidekick.\n  \n\u201cNah nah nah, it was my sister,\u201d said the ringleader in correction.\n  \nThis exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.\n  \nFor my neighbour is a drug-dealing maniac. A weird guy from Essex. He\u2019s in his mid-30s, about 5\u20198\u201d with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. He\u2019s skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. He smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn\u2019t enough to keep his energy in check.\n  \nSometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. [Like the time he made a wooden triangle](https://i.imgur.com/2E6FGuw.jpg). Or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. You know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night. \n  \nStill, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, I wasn\u2019t entirely keen on sending them next door. As much as I disliked my neighbour, I didn\u2019t think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. So I continued to try and talk these people out of the house.\n  \n\u201cI\u2019m not a drug dealer, so I\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s a couple of Macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an iMac\u2026 whatever you want, just take it and go mate.\u201d\n  \nHearing this offer, the ringleader realised I was being compliant. And if I was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn\u2019t I just give him the bag of money he was seeking? Slowly, the cogs turned.\n  \n\u201cIs this number 27?\u201d he demanded to know.\n  \n\u201cThe whole area is.\u201d\n  \n\u201cYeah but is this number two, twenty seven Acacia Avenue?\u201d\n  \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s number one.\u201d\n  \n\u201cWE\u2019VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!\u201d\n  \nThe realisation was startling. They all shouted. One guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. He had given up already. One or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my GF with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy I suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.\n  \n\u201cRight, you can\u2019t call the cops or we\u2019ll come back. We know where you live!\u201d The sidekick said.\n  \nEmboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, I laughed. \u201cYou seriously think I won\u2019t call the cops? Best I can do is give you a thirty second head start.\u201d\n  \nHe didn\u2019t like that, so he took my phone. Good, I thought. I\u2019ll track that fucker. Sadly, I later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.\n  \nThe ringleader then apologised. He said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. I said something along the lines of \u201cwell I am glad we sorted that out.\u201d At which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my GF would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.\n  \nI picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. Which it almost was.\n  \nLittle did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. But he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. My neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his GF, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.\n  \n\u201cTHE-GO-KID! THE-GO-KID! THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE!\u201d He screamed.\n  \n\u201cNo shit,\u201d I responded. \u201cWhy do you think my fucking door is wide open?\u201d\n    \nI went out to meet him while talking to the police on my GF\u2019s phone. He grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. I decided I was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.\n  \nIt took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. Eventually, my GF and I cautiously walked down to the living room. The police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. So they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. It\u2019s likely to be the only time I tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.\n  \nThe rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. They were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. Turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. As the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.\n  \n\u201cGo Kid! I just want to say one thing mate! I just want to say one thing!\u201d He screamed.\n  \n\u201cNeighbour, you\u2019re not physically capable of saying just one thing.\u201d\n  \nThe police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. This humiliation would haunt him for some time.\n  \nEventually I heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on Facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. A scumbag he\u2019d recently connected with on FB. He gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. To the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn\u2019t have the evidence to charge him.\n  \nAbout a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. \u201cThey terrorised us too!\u201d he said. He then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, I presume, torturing him. He tried to show me some sort of video evidence but I refused to look at it. \"We have to look after our women!\" he said.\n  \nHe then said that he was aware I had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. A bit bemused by this, I asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. This enraged him, and we haven't spoken a single word to each other since.\n  \nThe only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my Leatherman (it had 'That's not a knife' engraved in it). Nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. I moved house this year, so I can only hope I never see my neighbour's face again.\n  \n I know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but [it would appear I\u2019ve got back-up on that front](https://ol.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on Reddit and confirmed the story's validity on my original post! \n  \nTL:DR - Masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. Also, my neighbour is a knob.\n  \nEdit: I've been encouraged to post this bit of info as well - \n  \nThe police called it a \u2018scum on scum\u2019 attack, and when those inadvertently mess with innocent bystanders, the scumbags are usually apologetic. They even said \u201cdon\u2019t be surprised if you get an anonymous bunch of flowers\u201d. We didn't, but judging by some of the messages I have received, it really is something that happens.

{"listen": "  \n\nJust a quick warning that I am terrible at writing, but I just want to let this out. Here goes...\n\nI'm a seventeen year old Asian and a freshmen at a Community College. So, yesterday night I called my cousin and cried to him about how one of the classes I\u2019m taking right now is one of the most difficult thing I ever came across (The class is Human Anatomy and Physiology). I told him that I was going to fail because of an exam on Thursday and I already failed a quiz. I have a difficult time learning especially when it involves anatomy (not a big fan). My cousin told me it was best to slow down because of all the homework, quizzes and exams from the other classes can cause me to stress. He offered to talk to my dad about the situation to which I agreed. I called my cousin because I knew my dad was going to think that I wasn\u2019t fully giving the class my 100 percent. After a couple minutes of me crying alone my dad called me and asked why I was wanting to drop the class. I explain to him that I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him because he invested so much money in me and I didn\u2019t want the money to go to waste. Finally, me and my dad both agreed to go on Thursday to talk to an advisor and then we\u2019ll decide.\n\nThen rolls today. I finished my classes and was about to head home when I received a text from my dad. He told me to go ask a advisor about dropping the class and whether we would get a refund. I did what he said, but this moment here is where I messed up big time. When I asked the front office about withdrawing, they handed me a withdraw slip and next thing I knew, I was out of the Human Anatomy class (looking back at it now, I made one of the most dumbest move ever). When I finished, my dad called went commando on me when I told him what I did. He said that it was best to keep the class and fail than withdraw (I think it was better to withdraw, because then my GPA won\u2019t drop if I failed, but what do I know). He then proceeded to call me a useless stupid kid and question my actions before hanging up on me. I felt like shit there and then and still. While on the way home I felt like ending my life it would be quick and easy, but then I thought about my family and what they would have to go through. When I got home, my mom and grandma gave me a 10 minute lecture on why I made a shit move. They told me that my dad spends most of his time working 16 hours shifts nonstop and sleeps for only 5 hours before heading back to work just for me and I didn't even care that he goes through the pain. I cared and it hurt me, because I was the cause of my dad not being able to spend time with the family.\n\nI know it was a really bad decision made by me. Looking back, I wish I could just rewind time and stop it from happening. I feel like absolute shit right now and I question why my dad invested so much money on me. I know my dad is maybe wanting me to pay him back, because my dad paid for the class and I\u2019m willing to with all the money I received from my uncles and aunts when I graduated High School.\n\nI apologize for making you read this stupid terrible written story, but I just couldn't hold it in me anymore. This is one example of why I always allow other to call the shots because in the end I always manage to fuck it up somehow. I just\u2026 need some time to be alone... and do my Pre-Calculus homework.\n\nTL;DR Withdrew from Human Anatomy and Physiology class without my dads order and he\u2019s really pissed at me and my entire family probably hates me because I wasted so much money. Feeling like wanting to actually kill myself, but don\u2019t have the guts to. Willing to pay the money back to my dad.", "reply": "This is going to blow over.

{"listen": "Alt for obvious reasons. This happened a little over 13 hours ago. Let me start from the beginning, there's a lot of details to the story. Also I'd like to point out that I did not know it was a hotel employee's at the time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo at around 1pm I call home and get the whole spiel about working hard. Without going into too much detail, I was just generally frustrated at the start of the day.\n\nAt 2pm my buddy and I are getting Five Guys, and I ordered a burger and a \"Little\" fry (smallest size they have). Little did I know that apparently it's standard procedure for the workers to give you quadruple the amount of fries you expected. Not joking, the bottom half of the bag was *filled* with fries. I mean, free fries = no complaints here. But anyway, I ate my burger and as many fries as I could until I decided to save the rest for after class.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt 2:45pm I'm driving my buddy back to the hotel (19 of us live in a hotel while our new house gets built) and as I start to leave the lot, I see a car double-parked *directly center* over the yellow line. I didn't take a picture, but believe me when I say the yellow line was directly center under the car. This balls-of-steel move paired with my previous frustration led to me getting *pissed*. This had to be deliberate. The person who parked like that had to have done it on purpose, just to be an asshole.\n\nI immediately thought of those business cards you see online that say \"You park like an asshole\", but realized that those cards sadly only exist in my dreams, so I scrambled for a plan B. That's when I looked down at the greasy bag of projectiles at my feet. So with the blessing of God himself I mustered all my strength to grab that sweet, hefty scoop that only comes once in a generation, and I catapulted it out of my window at the back of the double-parked car. Only about four or five fries actually landed on the trunk, and the rest hit the ground. I then drove off with a big swinging dick, confident that I taught them a lesson the hard way not to double park.\n\n10 minutes later it's 3:30pm and I'm in class, and I start to feel bad about doing it. After all, maybe the owner was in a rush or had a bad day too. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen a little later, the buddy I dropped off texts me and says the hotel staff is looking for me. And they're pissed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere were no cameras in the parking lot or really anywhere in the hotel, so you might ask, how did I get caught? Well, the hotel parking lot is right outside the window next to the front desk, so they saw the car that did it. I've also been living in the hotel for a few weeks now so they recognize me and my name, and they also recognize the car I drive because it sticks out from the rest. I also did it in broad daylight, so that didn't help.\n\nAnyway, I immediately got worried because I both felt really bad and didn't want to have to pay some huge fine. So I called the front desk after class and said \"Hi, I'm the guy who threw the fries at the car\". I then asked to speak with the car owner, and after profusely apologizing, I explained the whole situation, offered to both buy her a voucher for the car wash down the street, and last but not least, offered to pick up the fries. So I did. (I also apologized in person when I got back to the hotel.)\n\nIn the end, I was on my hands and knees picking up fries off the ground of a parking lot. And to add insult to injury, the ground was covered in tiny pieces of a broken bottle. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut one last detail. After all of this, as I was slaving away picking up fries, I noticed something: the car was no longer double-parked. No, they moved it to a single parking space, like a civilized driver. For the rest of the day, I reveled in my little victory. Worth it.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR: Drove past a car in the hotel parking lot that was obviously double-parked on purpose, was already pissed at something unrelated, had a bunch of leftover fries, threw them out of my window at her car and drove to class, an hour later I got a text from my friend saying the hotel staff are looking for me. Ended up picking up fries off the ground which was conveniently covered in broken glass.**", "reply": "Why would you need to pick up fries?

{"listen": "This didn't happen today, rather 2 years ago. I'm on mobile, you guys know the drill.\n\nSo while browsing this beautiful sub, I was suddenly reminded of the moment I discovered how low I can get as a human being. Thinking back on it, it's kind of a funny story (and probably traumatizing for the poor kid and family involved), so since you guys have given me a lot of great stories, let me share mine.\n\nI was 19 at the time and working in a shitty IT helpdesk job. I just got off from work and I was going back home, anxious to get some food in my belly since it was 5pm and I haven't eaten since last night. On my way back home, I get a call from my buddy.\n\n\"Yo cockmuncher, wanna grab some pizza and a drink or two at [insert places name]?\"\n\nMy growling stomach and lack of a will to live at that point thanks to my job made the sound of both pizza and alcohol seem erotic.\n\n\"Fuck yeah, meet me there in 10 minutes\"\n\n10 minutes later and we got a seat and a beer at one of the outside tables. Now this pizza place was a kind of bar/restaurant gig, with all the tables and chairs being outside. They had the absolute best pizzas, cheap alcohol and a massive playground so it was routinely packed with families and students. We start talking shit, downing our beers, smoking our lungs out and waiting for the pizzas to come out.\n\nOne other thing about this place: the pizzas take FOREVER. The prep work on the pizzas alone probably takes them half an hour. My buddy and I are on our third draft by the time the pizza comes. But man I creamed myself when I did see them come.\n\nWe proceed to slam back our beers and dig in. I down my entire brand new draft and feel the bubbles start to build up. Uh oh. I try to release the gas by burping but the bubbles are fizzing up faster than I can release them. On top of that, thanks to me not eating all day as well, my stomach is beginning to fight back against me in protest from the lack of care I've been giving it. This isn't looking good.\n\nBeing the concerned friend he was, my buddy proceeded to laugh and slap me on my back, hard. And that bursts open the dam walls. In order to not throw up on our still hot from the oven pizzas, I turn my head to the side and let it all out, unable to contain it any more.\n\nAll over the toddler who was sitting at the table with his family next to us.\n\nAll I hear is my friend wheezing in the background, and the giant fucking bear of a man father emitting an arse puckering \"*WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO*\"\n\nI grab some napkins and try to stand up so I can help this crying kid deal with the aftermath of my poor life choices, but then it hit me.\n\nFirst the alcohol, then papa bears fist.\n\nI lose my footing and I swear my soul leaves my body for a second. I rejoice, for mortal problems do not affect the dead. I snap back a second later and curse God and Satan for not taking me when they had the chance. Papa bear is standing over me and is about to smash his meaty fists into my face once again, and my drunken mind isn't gonna stand for it.\n\nIn a drunken fury I rolled to the side of his pavement-smashing fist and stood up, my rage and adrenaline momentarily burning away the last few beers. And we spar.\n\nIt lasts about 5 seconds before he picks me up like I was a toy and throws me against the wall. By this point the manager and a few of the beefier staff have arrived. Seeing that I'm already no longer a threat considering I got thrown like a dirty cum rag against the wall, they focus on papa bear. After he had about 5 guys clinging to his limbs and trying to restrain him, he decides he's over me and goes back to his still-crying kid and frantic wife. I was then promptly picked up by the staff, carried out of the establishment and firmly told that I will be arrested on site if I come back.\n\nSupposedly after the incident they implemented a \"no under 21s allowed unless with parent supervision\" rule.\n\nTL;DR got drunk off beer with an empty stomach, projectile vomited onto a toddler, fist fought the dad, got banned from the establishment and got every other person under 21 banned as well unless with supervision.\n\n**Edit:** for those of you asking \"how the hell did you get alcohol at 19?\", I live in a country that's legal drinking age is 18\n\n**Edit 2:** Obligatory *ThIsBlEwUp* edit, wow 10k updoots!

{"listen": "Five days ago, my fiancee and I decided to evacuate from a city directly on the coast of North Carolina with our two children, due to record storm surge predictions and possible flooding. We left most of our belongings behind, and attempted to bring everything that was important to us in the space of our small Jeep.\n\nTwo days ago was when everything got real. I won the N.C. educational lottery ($50,000) in a second chance drawing for scratch off cards that weren\u2019t winners. Basically you scan your losing scratch off card, collect points, and enter into drawings every month for different prizes. I personally do not like scratch offs, but my mother enjoys them and gives us her loser cards since the second chance process is sort of tedious.\n\nAwesome, right? Nope. The NCEL refuses to disburse winnings without a valid drivers license and social security card. My license and social security card are located in our apartment back near the coast, which experienced 5 feet of flood waters so far, and is close to collapsing in on itself. While I do have photocopies of these documents, the regional NCEL offices have all refused to accept them as valid ID documents. In order to get a new license with the DMV, I am required to have my social security card. In order to obtain a new social security card, I require my license.\n\nWe are currently staying at my fianc\u00e9es mother\u2019s house in VA, and currently have no plans on how to move forward. We will likely be homeless and without income for the foreseeable future. This money could have been a new start for us. Instead, it\u2019s a point of massive stress during a crisis situation. I am thankful that we are safe. I am hoping that my friends and family who stayed in the path of Florence are all safe. I would give anything for this all to be a dream, and wake up without having won the lottery or a hurricane bearing down on everything I hold dear.\n\nTL;DR evacuated from the path of a major hurricane.  Forgot documents required to claim lotto winnings.\n\nEdit:  Death threats?  Wishing for my family to die?

{"listen": "This happened last night, so technically it wasn't today, although activities may have extended into this morning. I typed it up right after a pregnancy test.\n\nI'll start with how I met my girlfriend. We were at a summer camp, (we're both juniors) and things happened in that two week period that resulted in a relationship. To be frank, that was my first relationship, since prior to that I was much more focused on grades and education. It was your typical nerd fetish of \"landing the hot blonde\", although I was more thrown into the relationship, although once I was I relished it. However, she lives in Seattle, while I'm down in North Carolina, literally right off the path of Florence (which I really hoped and still hope would/will come and kill me). We \"dated\" halfway through the camp, a result of going off the college campus for eating. When we finished, I met her parents as they picked her up, but she never met mine. As a result, my parents never knew anything-- in fact, nobody did except for one of my friends who went on the cruise trip directly following, and basically everyone she knew. This never seemed to be really important for me, since I'm new to all this relationship stuff. Actually my friend who commonly browses reddit and my user will probably see this, so when I ride the school bus tomorrow I might be cucked even more.\n\nSpeaking of Hurricane Florence, it was actually the reason she came over; for, two days ago, with odd motives, she had traveled over to Wilmington rather than California for the beach with a group of her friends, and obviously was in direct path of the storm. With nowhere else to go, they ran towards the RDU triangle, which was the \"clear zone\" of the storm and rented a hotel. Me, seeing her story on Instagram, was an idiot and offered to give her stay. This was basically me, someone who pokes his friends with pencils (it was studying for AP Psych last year) thinking about others before him. Before my numbskull could realize that 1). she would be staying with my parents, who had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA that she existed, 2). I would be living with a girlfriend I haven't seen in about two months, who lives normally halfway across the country, and 3). events like these typically result in disaster, she replied with a \"Sure, thanks!\" and my plan was underway. Then I realized all these three shit points, but I was too scared to send these back because I'm an introvert and I don't want to lose the closest thing I have to a relationship because I'm insecure and use HTTPS Everywhere. \n\nI then proceeded to start telling my parents about this, where my dad just sat there silent and looking amused why my mom was getting increasingly infuriated. After I finished (the story during which my mother interjected MULTIPLE times) my mom seemed more mad about how I never told her about this person rather than their stay here. My dad, on the other hand, seemed more relieved that I wasn't a complete social outcast and a homosexual (because from his time, especially where he comes from, China, this is kinda big) and let it pass, which was the complete opposite of what I was thinking. My mom at that point proceeded to start trying to gossip, etc. about this stuff because parents. About two hours later, she arrived, and we (I) unpackaged her stuff into my room. \n\nNow the first night we didn't do anything really, just slept (me for about 3 hours) but the second night we did; I actually blame the person at my camp for giving me an way oversized condom because I brought Cards Against Humanity over and he had multiple condoms to give out. I had never planned on having sex as a high school student because I am semi-socially awkward and the only girl I relatively knew were my 6 year old sister and my girlfriend. As a result, the only condom I had was one that was ridiculously oversized. Confession: I do NOT have a 10-inch dick. As a result, with the reassurances of a condom and probably not having the chance for the next ten years until I remember Tinder,  we decided to set upon yesterday. This ended with the condom leaking, and some surprise and stress, followed up by a pregnancy test which resulted in a positive. In fact, so far we two are the only ones that know about this (unless she's putting this on her snapchat story) and putting it up here is more like an anonymity breaker. \n\n**TL;DR:** I met a girl at camp (both juniors) who lives on the opposite coast of me, who came over for vacation which was the first time my parents met her, got hurricaned into my home and got pregnant as a result. Nobody else knows.\n\nEDIT 1: So apparently I know nothing about Sex Ed because I was busy playing Clash Royale when I was in that class... I'm gonna go look at a doctor to make sure that the baby isn't real, because, according to the helpful and supporting comments, the only possible causes were a prior pregnancy and a really shitty test. I kinda just overreacted and posted this, literally a tifu within a tifu. Thanks for those who gave me information and brought me out of stress mode!\n\nEDIT 2: So I told her about the entire doctor thing (and apparently she doesn't understand how babies work either) and about how I was gonna schedule an appointment; she stayed silent for about thirty minutes and said that it was all a prank; etc. Obviously, this feels like a scam, so should i immediately dump, or entertain this further? Thanks again to all of your support during this!\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks to /u/FlagShack for the gold, even though I don't feel like this post deserves it... really I've learned my lesson and deserve a fucking whopping for the idiocy of not listening in sex ed.", "reply": "Why didn\u2019t y\u2019all go and pick up a plan B pill the next day?"}

I'm guessing the embarrassment saved me from the pain at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: was going to get my glasses, tried to jump an unlatched gate segment of a fence that was in my path, gate opened landed on my ass, everyone saw, now my right ass cheek hurts like hell.", "reply": "Jumping a fence almost never ends well"}

{"listen": "TIFU by orgasming so hard I broke my vagina\n\nHappened a couple of days ago, as is tradition. Throwaway because some IRL folks know my normal handle on here.\n\n\nSo a couple of months ago my doctor put me on a new SSRI to help with my chronic depression. It didn't work that well and made me super-dazed, and on top of that my sex drive dried up to a level that can only be described as \"Sahara-like.\" Now, it's not like I'm in a relationship or anything, but I still enjoyed getting off at least a couple times a week, and found myself very wound up without my normal release.\n\n\nI told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an SNRI and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. After work one day, I came home and decided to treat myself to a round or two with my vibrator, to celebrate. Well, it had been building up so long in me that I went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. I should note at this point that I didn't use lube, because I was so..worked up..I figured I didn't need it.\n\n\nSounds great, right? Eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, I realized I had a shooting pain in my vagina, like I had badly pulled a muscle. After spending a couple of minutes laying in state, praying to every god and deity out there to make the pain subside, I made the long, labored waddle to the toilet, only to realize I was dripping a lot of blood, too. \n\n\nBefore you ask, no, it was not shark week for me, so needless to say, I was surprised. Upon further inspection, I realized that I not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, I suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. However, it was a lot more blood than any little tears I had had in the past, and prior to this, I never tore from masturbating, so I was convinced I really badly injured myself, and may need stitches.\n\n\nI called my OB's office and made an appointment, and I explained what happened, all while turning shade of purple that Barney the dinosaur would envy. My doctor took a look and welp, I was right, I needed stitches, and instructed me that in the future during any particularly-intense sessions, I should probably use lube, just to be safe. Ironically, now I now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so I'm back to square one. \n\n\nNeedless to say, the whole experience was not what I was expecting, and has been something I would prefer to not experience, ever again.\n\n\nTL;DR Got super horny, overdid it during a solo session, and broke my vagina.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the lube tips, guys. Just ordered (look up the drum of lube on Amazon, was apparently inadvertently linking to my wishlist, too) so I think I'm good to go for future sexytimes! (Not really, but I did order a few different brands suggested and really appreciate it!) \n\nEDIT 2: Been getting a lot of questions about my antidepressants. I was on Celexa and am not on Cymbalta. Feel free to PM me if you have any further questions, happy to have helped some folks out \ud83d\ude00. Sorry if it takes me a while to respond, been getting A TON of questions and I want to make sure I answer them all, thoroughly!\n\nEDIT 3: Gold! Holy crap, thank you, internet stranger! Who knew my most read post would ever be about injuring my vajayjay...I'll take this opportunity to throw out a LPT: LUBE, LUBE, AND LUBE SOME MORE!

{"listen": "This occurred around the time I turned 17. The budget was tight, and all I could afford was Ol\u2019 rickety. For the enthusiasts, this was a 68 F100, rust in color with olive green shining through in a few areas. It looked like something a sex offender retired a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWell she\u2019s no panty dropper,\u201d The haggard prior owner told me, \u201cBut she\u2019ll get you from A to B most of the time. Don\u2019t try to make it to C though\u201d\n\nYoung and na\u00efve, I was actually excited for this arrangement. I shelled out the $500 and drove her home. The absolute first thing my new ride needed was a cooler steering wheel. $40 at a parts store and a hacksaw later, I pretty much had a racecar. (We later spray-painted the number 7 on the doors and hood for good measure).\n\n\\-Stay with me, this gets great. (well better anyways)\n\nFast forward a day or so and it was time to take her on a trip into the city. Of course, I end up stalled at a busy intersection. I try to give her some gas, and the engine dies. *Of course* it won\u2019t start back up. Rush hour, MIDDLE of the intersection with 4 lanes in every direction honking at me. Panic ensued as I tried to hop out and push it, a growing mob of furious motorists sharpening pitchforks.\n\nFortunately, my luck turned for the better as a police officer pulled up. This guy has the audacity to ask the typical cop question \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure, I think they\u2019re all trying to get somewhere...\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem to get the joke, and offered to use his car pushers to get me out if the intersection. (Things on the front of police cars for\u2026 Exactly this?) I told him if he wanted to mess up a perfectly good cop car, he was welcome to try. He seemed like a new guy and was grinning about getting to do cop stuff.\n\nSo off we went, a minor slam and we were rolling. I cranked the wheel hard left, it took all my might without the power steering. Remember the hacksaw/steering wheel thing? Well in my haste, this truly may have been the biggest TIFU moment. I had not installed the steering wheel with a lock-nut, so turning it hard enough left would cause it to literally unscrew. We were picking up speed when the wheel spun loose in my hand and sent me on a course straight for the massive light pole. Clearly, I did not have many options and put both feet hard on the brakes in hopes that the officer would get the message. Unbeknownst to me, he actually wasn\u2019t pushing anymore, and must have been 2-3 feet behind me. This was a detriment to both of us as I felt a slam that jarred my back and made me bop my forehead on the loose fit steering wheel. I heard a quick sharp \u201cBOMPP\u201d of a car horn right when we impacted, so I speculate that is where his face made contact as well.\n\nThe officer stormed out of his police car, wiping his nose as he did that angry cop walk toward me. This guy was very obviously new at this point, as he seemed to word vomit cop things without actually getting anywhere. The corner of his mouth was bleeding slightly.\n\n\u201cGet out of the vehicle! The fuck\u2026 what the hell are you thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet back in your vehicle, we need to get this\u2026P.O.S. off my road! NOW!\u201d\n\nFortunately, I was able to use a tire iron to tighten the steering wheel back up while he was doing his thing, he finally figured out what was going on and stomped back to his vehicle for round 2. This time the gods blessed our voyage and I was able to creep it to a nearby parking lot. We both exited our vehicles and for a brief instant I thought we were going to brawl. The mood was right, the adrenaline was right, and the circumstances were right. I really thought we might fight.\n\n\u201cThis *thing\u2026* is NOT safe to drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it even have insurance? Where\u2019s the license plate? Is it... registered?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s literally where I was headed sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 get it fixed first.. Jesus! And do I need to search the vehicle?\u201d More cop vomit as I realize there\u2019s a bong on the floorboards.\n\n\u201cUh no, it\u2019s pretty boring, just broke truck stuff mostly\u201d\n\nHe said something else as he turned and cop-stomped back to his crown vic. I took a quick peek at his car and was surprised at how mangled his car pushers were. Aside from that the damage was minimal. Of course, ol\u2019 rickety had no noticeable damage, and started right up when I got back behind the wheel.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 Broke down in a busy intersection, had to have a cop push me, steering wheel came off, had to hit the brakes, cop crashed into me. *Gave his face a schoolin.*\n\nPRE-EDIT \u2013 I drove it for several months and ended up totaling it in a similarly comical fashion. If viewers would like, I\u2019ll gladly write it up.\n\nEDIT - To dampen off the death threats, yes the original steering wheel was spindled. The replacement was not. Google autozone steering wheel. It requires some sort of dimpled locking washer. The original being ancient required a pump puller to remove. The arms going from the center out to the steering handle parts were in the way and had to be hacked off. Does that make more sense? Please stop threatening to kill my family. Just assume it makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Requested crashing posted [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9gtr6x/tifu_by_wrecking_ol_rickety_a_followup_fuckup/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "reply": "That was a great read, follow up wreck story please!

I was driving in my area one afternoon on my way home from work, and from home I\u2019d be headed to band practice (I was in a lame country/80\u2019s rock band at the time). Had an old Honda Accord (98) that me and my stoner friends lovingly called \u201cThe Accord\u201d (also, the weed didn\u2019t do much for our creativity). I went straight through a green light and immediately saw flashing lights behind me so I pulled into a nearby gas station lot. Had no idea why I was getting pulled, but I was a pothead and an internet user - I knew my rights and, thank god, I didn\u2019t have any buds to smoke in my car that day. Cop comes up and does the cop thing, then tells me he pulled me over because of the little pine tree air freshener hanging from my rearview - it\u2019s a visual obstruction.

{"listen": "Okay, so obligatory 'this wasn't actually today' disclaimer, but this did happen on Saturday. However, because my boyfriend actively uses reddit and will most likely see this, I figured I'd do the respectful thing and wait two days before I posted this super flattering story.\n\n\nSome important details to keep in mind:\n\n1. my boyfriend is deathly allergic to peanuts and has been since he was just a wee child.\n\n2. I'm a dumbass.\n\n\n\nSo, this past weekend marked our one-year anniversary, which is a huge feat in and of itself given detail #2 spelled out above. To celebrate, we decided to go out for a super fancy dinner -- the ol' OG Olive Garden.\n\n\nBeing a fourth-year student at university, I've gotten very used to not wearing makeup, but I decided to go all out for our anniversary dinner. I even went out and bought a lip-plumping gloss so my bf could pretend he was dating a Kardashian for the day instead of plain old u/kate-plus-self-hate. Supposedly, the gloss works by searing your lips until they are huge, red, numb, and possibly burned to the first degree -- needless to say, it was unpleasant to use but I still thought it was worth it.\n\n\nFast forward to my boyfriend picking me up and us detouring to an empty parking lot for a quick-ish makeout sesh. An hour later, we arrived at Olive Garden and started in on the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. We're maybe 15 minutes into dinner, and my bf starts complaining that his lips are tingling and that he feels kind of funny. I think nothing of it at first, but as we keep eating, he says the feeling was getting more intense and was spreading to his neck, abdomen, and *nervous glance* his nether regions.\n\n\nMy first thought was that he was hamming things up, but after a few minutes I could tell he wasn't faking anything. My next logical thought was that our food had come in contact with peanuts and that he was starting to have an allergic reaction. He agreed because he couldn't think of any other reason he would be experiencing the symptoms that he was.\n\n\nAt this point, I'm starting to freak out -- I don't want to be responsible for killing the only human who voluntarily spends time with me -- so I take my bf's keys and race out to his car. I knew he kept an emergency EpiPen in his glove box, so I fished that out, ran back into the restaurant, and jammed that fucker into his thigh.\n\n\nFast forwarding one more time, I flagged down our waiter to pay for our check, rushed my bf back out to his car, and drove like a maniac to the closest open urgent care facility. The practitioner there ran tests for his white blood cell counts and all of that fun shit, after which she told him that he's just fine and that none of their tests came back that he was having an allergic reaction. She asked him if he had come into contact with anything that might have been irritating his skin...\n\n\n...and that's when my last two functioning brain cells decided to start working. The whole thing was my fault. The only possible explanation for the whole ordeal was that I got my probably-FDA-rejected lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend's body.\n\n\nMy bf was less than enthused when we got home and I told him what I thought had happened. In fact, he made me throw the gloss out immediately. A few hours later, he (and my own lips) went back to normal, but at least this makes for an anniversary we won't forget...\n\n\nTL;DR: I mistook my getting lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend for him dying from a peanut allergy.", "reply": "That lip gloss sounds like cruel and unusual punishment"}

{"listen": "This just happened last week. I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. \u201cBeth\u201d comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. \n\nI am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  \n\nWe get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says \u201cOh. My goodness, what happened?\u201d  So I respond as a joke \u201cEh, she got out of line\u201d.   \n\nI know!  It\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I\u2019m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It\u2019s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. \n\nHe comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor\u2019s office to talk.  \n\nThere is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth\u2019s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. \n\nThe police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. \n\nThe police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. \n\nWe get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  \n\nThe county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don\u2019t need to make for this week.  I can\u2019t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I\u2019m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  \n\ntl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  \n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit 2:  Update\nThank you for the gold kind strangers.\nWow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.\n\n1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.\n\n2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.\n\n3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  \n\n4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for \"clean up\".  It turned out to be nothing.", "reply": "It was a good joke though.

{"listen": "Not today, but about a month ago. The shame has only died down enough to talk about it.\n\nMy husband works night shifts at the hospital a lot and so his schedule can be off even when he doesn\u2019t work. This means he does a lot of house chores and errands at weird hours. He has lived in the city quite a while, where I moved here while he finishes school from a town in Wyoming where we don\u2019t lock our doors and our bikes sit on our lawns. We are getting ready to sell my Outback as we only have one parking spot here and I have a motorcycle so for the most part I can just use his car if I need to otherwise I can just take the bike. The night before the fuck up, my husband had used my car to go the hardware store to go get some hooks.\n\nSo, the fuck up - I was in line for the car wash the next morning with my dog in the back seat when I noticed this thing that looked like a squirt gun. \u201cCute\u201d! I think. I pick it up. It says, \u201cPepper Blaster\u201d. \u201cWow, it\u2019s an spice grinder for camping, cool\u201d. So I put the \u201cspice gun\u201d to my hand and press the trigger thinking I\u2019ll get a spritz of salt and pepper. \n\nWRONG. Apparently pepper spray comes in gun form.\n\nIt\u2019s like a spring goes off and all of a sudden I\u2019m covered in red. Did I shoot myself?! Is this blood? I\u2019m dying?? And I\u2019m sneezing. My dog is sneezing. And I\u2019m trapped in the car wash line with no escape. Then my face starts to burn. And I look up and the red is all over the headliner. Somehow I go through the wash and drive home.\n\nAnyway,  it resulted in me having my face in a bowl of milk and more than 4 hours of scrubbing the top off the car. I paid $200 to get the car head to toe detailed and It\u2019s better but still there. They said I might be able to use a special technique to paint so I may try it out on the sun visor. I\u2019m an idiot. \n\nI still pretend to blame my husband for leaving it there.\n\nTLDR: husband leaves pepper spray gun in car and grown woman pepper sprayed herself probably making it infinitely harder to sell her previously pristine car. \n\n\n[the damage](https://imgur.com/gallery/Vx0g1jP)\n\nEdit: [current state](https://imgur.com/a/geAtg0Q) \n\nEdit 2: [the gun now has a place in the spice rack ](https://imgur.com/a/bo1NFFG) \n\nEdit 3: for all those asking Bagel Dog is more than fine [and as spoiled as ever](https://imgur.com/a/nQ7DJA9) ", "reply": "Is the dog okay?"}

{"listen": "This actually just happened a couple of hours ago. I'm a math TA at my college, and I was working my weekly shift. Nobody had come in for help, so I was pretty bored all night long. I also have a cold, so I had been blowing my nose pretty frequently throughout the shift.\n\nThere were about 30 minutes left in my shift, and I could feel my nose about to drip. I was out of kleenex, so I got up to grab a napkin from the corner. As I'm blowing my nose, I feel a weird feeling in my head. Immediately, I recalled a family friend of mine who had a brain aneurysm triggered by blowing her nose. I know it's ridiculous (which I'm realizing even more as I type this out), but because that's what my head immediately went to, I just had to know what the symptoms of a brain aneurysm might be.\n\nI did a Google search, and the first thing I read was \"An unruptured aneurysm usually causes no symptoms.\" Now, I'm someone who gets queasy at anything medical like this, but this was a new record. After reading this, I thought to myself \"oh fuck\", and then proceeded to tunnel-vision. My last thought was \"shit I think I'm gonna fain---\"\n\nNext thing I know I was being helped across the room by another TA in the room, and I had no idea what had happened yet. As I get to the other side of the room, another TA comes in with a medical student (the med college was in the same building), and this guy asks me to lay down on the ground. He asks me to lay down on the ground, and that's when I notice my hand covered in blood. I start to panic, and when I try to sit up, I immediately started to tunnel-vision again, so I quickly put my head back down to keep from fainting again. Then they covered my brow with paper towel, which indicated to me where I hit my head. I was asked questions such as \"what day is it today\" and \"who is our president,\" both of which I knew.\n\nOverall it was a wild series of events. EMTs were called, and ambulance was sent to my location. A few friends of mine were in the building, and they came to make sure I was okay. After ten minutes or so I felt fine aside from being a little shaky after everything had happened, and a hospital stretcher was brought in. '*Shit*' I thought, as I know how much an ambulance trip costs and idk jack shit about my family's health insurance policy. To make matters worse, half of the people in the room thought I should go to the ER to make sure everything was okay, and the other half told me that I was fine and didn't need it. Still in shock, I opted not to go, and I've felt fine ever since aside from a bit of a headache from hitting my head.\n\nAfter everything went down, my understanding is that I fell out of my chair and hit my head on the wheel of a table in the room. I was out for about 20 seconds, and I clearly scared the living shit out of the other TAs that were there. Overall though, I was very impressed with how the situation was handled. The other TAs were quick to get multiple sources of help, and the med student had arrived by the time I came to. He was very knowledgeable and was able to replicate many of the questions the EMT had asked me when he got there. I'm just glad to say that I wasn't alone when I fainted, otherwise I might not still be here. Anyways, I'll probably will be taking the day to relax tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR: Felt a unique feeling in my head after blowing my nose, googled brain aneurysm symptoms, and got queasy and fainted.

{"listen": "I had a lovely teacher who gave a very long and detailed description about her laser eye surgery. I also walked out of the classroom and someone fetched me when she was done. (It was costuming class, not like anything important was really going on). \n\nBlood pressure cuffs always seem to spike my BP too. I tell doctors and they just kind of chuckle like that's normal. I can literally feel my BP raising the moment the cuff is velcro'd. \n\nConversely, there's this new wrist cuff that's *way* better. Of course, now I've got the association of \"they're measuring my BP and they're going to tell me it's high\" so of course BP tests stress me out and raise my BP... \n\nHighly recommend asking to lay down next time you get a blood test, though!

HR is always over 120 when they put the cuff on me and I start freaking on the inside no matter how hard I try to convince myself I'm being dumb.\n\nOddly enough, whenever my BP is manually taken and I'm panicking, it's in the normal range, or even quite low; whereas when I use a machine it gets insanely high, like 160/100, and I'm a teenage girl. I've since stopped checking it on a machine since it was getting literally obsessive. The numbers would eventually get lower and lower and then when I hit a normal range I'd take it for the 30th time to \"double check\" and it'd be back up.\n\n\nStill dreading an upcoming dr visit where I have to explain to the doc my irrational phobia.

{"listen": " \n\nI can only type this now, weeks after the mistake. The skin was peeling on my hands, and though it didn\u2019t hurt, it was quite annoying. It looked horrible as well. The brilliant idea came to use callous remover (it removes dead skin, right?) to take off the outer layer that was falling off.\n\nIt worked... in a sense. I put the callous remover in latex gloves, rubbed it around to distribute it around, then put my hands in. I planned to leave them in for 5 minutes. After about 1 minute, a searing pain began to shoot up my arms. I ripped off the gloves and ran to wash my hands. I felt satisfied for a moment as I saw dead skin collecting in the bottom of the sink; however, my mood dropped when I noticed how red my hands looked. The callous remover did its job, removing a layer or two of skin. My hands would no longer be peeling. The problem was that every small crevice in my hand, every wrinkle, and every groove deeper than a fingerprint ridge began to bleed. I tried to clean my hands and the pain increased. They had to be carefully dried and wrapped.\n\nImagine a paper cut. Now, imagine a paper cut between the webs of your fingers. Now imagine thousands of paper cuts in all the grooves of your hands. I was unable to move my fingers without reopening the cuts and restarting all the pain. I could not type, text, open a door, write, pick up a book, or grab in any significant way without more pain. I remained in that state for three days. Then I could begin to do minor tasks. Now, more than two weeks later, I feel fine to type this story.\n\nTL;DR I used callous remover to remove the skin on my hands. It did, and my hands bled with the pain of a thousand paper cuts.", "reply": "Hi Siri, call 911"}

{"listen": "While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It\u2019s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It\u2019s a remarkable sight. \n\nFor those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify\u2026 I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there\u2019s another reason to steer clear.\n\nAnyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. \n\nA genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. \n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a clever idea!\u201d I thought, relieved that we wouldn\u2019t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. \n\nAh but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe early effects weren\u2019t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: \n\n\u201cHey we need to\u2026. We need to\u2026 do something\u2026 like\u2026 now?\u201d I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. \n\nThis was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.\n\n\u201cSergeant, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m high as shit!\u201d He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. \n\n\u201cSomeone, relieve him!\u201d (genius)\n\nSeveral individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. \n\n\u201cWho the hell approved this!!?\u201d The First Sergeant yelled\n\n\u201cI believe you did..\u201d The CO responded \n\n\u201cWell where\u2019s the detail that brought it in?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat would be us First-Sergeant\u201d Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned\u2026 I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking \u201cohjesusohjesusohjesus I\u2019m going to get caught...!\u201d It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. \n\nI turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other\u2019s laps, goofing off, and having a \u2018deep philosophical conversation\u2019 about a bug\u2019s journey through life.\n\nInert.\n\nI wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.\n\nI assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.\n\nAt this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. \n\nAlthough I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.\n\n \n\nTL;DR \u2013 Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.", "reply": "Hope u feel good about ruining the life of the poor farmers.

I finished my business, went for a quick zip and promptly caught myself in my zipper. As you can imagine, this was quite painful and I was left with limited options.  The picture attached is worth 1000 expletives.\n\nI want to give a huge shout out to my amazing wife who came home from work to help me free myself which saved me an ER visit (probably $500). We were able to remove the zipper from the pants with a good kitchen shears. We then used astroglide to free the zipper.\n\n[Pic](https://ibb.co/b8SRWe)\n\nTL:DR\n\nWasn't paying attention and caught myself in pants zipper.

{"listen": "This occurred on Tuesday but i read that sex related TIFU are for weekends.\n\nI'm a regular blood donor and i also keep fit. No diabetes, regular blood pressure so am generally in okay health.\n\nWent to the blood bank to drop my quarterly 500cc of blood. Usually i hydrate real well and have a decent meal after to help replenish. But that day, i got a call from work ( i drop by in my lunch break) and had to rush back. So rather than a sit down meal with lots of veggies and protein i grab a glazed donut and whatever came in a bottle to go. They didn't have water so i grabbed like so soda like thing, i dont even remember, anyhoo it was laden with sugar.\n\nImmediately i felt the buzz of the sugar high. So for the rest of the day i am feeling a little light headed ( slightly normal after I donate), but also slightly nauseous and a little on edge.\n\nI go home and for whatever reason i am pretty turned on, so as soon as i can i seduce the missus and we get it on.\n\nNow, i pause here to add that after donating blood, i am usually advised to not do vigorous exercise lift weights for 48-72 hrs. Now i have broken all the rules, am dehydrated, experience hyperglycaemia and i'm pushing my blood and heart to do some serious cardio.\n\nSo, we're doing the deed, its going good, i am slightly delirious and then boom i puke out lunch and dinner on my wife and she tells me i just collapse on her after.\n\nI of course don't remem ber any of this but i wake up in the ER with a drip and a very cross wife with puke stained hair staring at me. Doctor says i should be fine but not try whatever it is i did  after donating blood. Turns out they ping everytime a donor comes in the ER. Apparently if I wasn't qyite so healthy, the self induced hyperglycemia  could have resulted in a coma or possible blown blood vessel somewhere like my brain.\n\nTl:dr donated blood, didnt rehydrate, took too much sugar, had sex, nearly had a stroke.\n\n\n\nEdit 3: wow this blew up. Okay a few things. First of all thank you all for the concern, diabetes is hereditary in my family. I get tested regularly but after this episode i am getting a full physical just to be sure. We told the doctor i was \"working out\", and he just nodded. He thinks its a confluence  of too much sugary stuff ( i didnt eat that much proper food that day), fatigue (i hadnt been sleeping much coz of work), dehydration, and the blood loss. \n\nAnd yes my wife has forgiven me, she is my wife after all. She finds the \"fucked him out of his mind\" brag really funny. And she assures me we can have sexy time as long as i use a horses feedbag.\n\nLastly, PSA: i am still going to keep donating blood. Doctor said he doesnt see why not unless the physical says otherwise. Please consider donating if you have not. It saves lives and blood banks are always running low. If you take away anything from my TIFU its that giving blood while \"risky\" is totally worth it, had sex right ;)\n\nEdit 4: wow thank you for the gold kind stranger!", "reply": "You do a lot to replenish.

{"listen": "This happened about 40min ago. Also for context, I live in Australia, and have arachnophobia from a traumatic childhood experience involving floodwaters. \n\nAs of tomorrow, I am going to be away from home, on an 8 day film shoot across the east coast of NSW. Each day is about a 14 hour day. Naturally, I decided to have a nice long relaxing shower before I left. \n\nAbout 4 mins into my planned 25min shower, I was midway through shampooing my hair when I felt something. Like a sixth sense something-ain\u2019t-quite-right-here type of something. I look up above me, and to my HORROR, a black, eight-legged, piece-of-shit, shower-ruining, house spider dropping down its web towards me via the air vent.\n\nAustralian children are taught very young to stay away from spiders. It\u2019s common knowledge that the black ones can cause extreme pain, seizures, death, so I know my daycare teachers would be proud seeing my 6\u20192, 91kg, naked male body glide through my sliding shower doors and onto the tile floor, covered in shampoo.\n\nThey\u2019d be extra proud of me, without thinking, grabbing the toxic insect spray, and proceeding to blast the shower and spider, with a fallout cloud that would rival the scene from T2: Judgement Day. \n\nThey would NOT be proud of me, however, of being so paranoid about seeing the spider die, that I stood in the enclosed, steamy room, inhaling the fumes to see it. It wasn\u2019t until I realised my eyes were watering and I could smell a stinging sensation that I realised I had unintentionally gassed myself. \n\nSo my naked, wet, bloodshot-eyed, dumbass attempted to run out of the bathroom, to escape dying via ALDI cheap bug spray. Attempted, because I then proceeded to trip over where the bathroom tile meets the kitchen tile, and promptly give myself a bloody nose. In the nude.\n\nI have checked the label and the poison assures me the symptoms I experienced are the worst it\u2019ll get. My nose is ok, the bleeding has stopped. And yes, the spider is dead.\n\nTL;DR spider attacked, sprayed poison in the shower. Poison got in my face, fell over and gave myself a blood nose attempting to escape. \n\nEDITS: \n1. I live off tankwater, and being away for 8 days, I decided to have a longer shower than usual, because it\u2019ll fill up. I\u2019m normally a 4-6min guy.\n\n2.

{"listen": "As is the standard disclaimer, this took place on February 23, 2017. \n\nFor a few days my back had been hurting, but I didn\u2019t really care, as I was in my junior year of high school and I totally didn\u2019t care enough. Worth mentioning was that I hadn\u2019t felt the need to poo for a full week. \n\nTo understand the importance of that statement, one has to understand that at the time I would take a crap regularly, as in once a day every day. So when I wasn\u2019t clearing my pipes, it was a matter for concern. \n\nBack to the morning of February 23, I was in pain. I couldn\u2019t sit up straight at school, I was constantly grunting to cope, but after the first few periods I was managing and it didn\u2019t hurt me too much. When school was out, I was feeling like cash money, and decided I wanted to take a nap. Generally I don\u2019t like to wear a shirt at home, but at the time I was very into inspecting my abdomen to see how it was shaping up. Classic teenage boy things. \n\nAnyways, after emptying the old trouser snake, I looked at my mirror and gave my midsection a peek. Instead of the sight of my normally rather flat stomach, I was greeted to my body being curved. The left side of my body was considerably more concave than the right, and that\u2019s where it lined up with the hurt in my back. Panic ensued as I informed my mother. \n\nFast forward a half hour, and I\u2019m being inspected at a clinic. Of course, the doctors there are quite perplexed, and I need an x-ray. They inform me that I should probably head to the ER, since they don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nAt the ER, I of course get another x-ray. They wheel me around in a wheelchair, where I\u2019m comically hunched to the side like the crooked man. I get scanned and it\u2019s back to a hospital bed with me. Eventually, they pull my mother out to ask her a few questions and tell her what they think. At that point I\u2019m going a mile minute, absolutely terrified of what it could be. One nurse mentioned kidney stones, which also happen to be one of my biggest fears. \n\nImagine my surprise when my mom walks in with the doctor and asks me when the last time I \u201ctook a crap\u201d was. I tried to recall and realized that I in fact could not remember. It was at that point the doctor informed me that I was absolutely filled with stool. I of course laughed, which hurt like the dickens. They gave me a muscle relaxant, pain killers, and a prescribed stool softener. \n\nThe next few days were spent with me trying to drop a deuce after drinking a cup of water mixed with powdered laxative. I was met with the sounds of rushing air and no real substance time and time again, until finally the gates opened and I took my first real number 2 in days. \n\nTo add to it, the more matter I defecated, the more relaxed the muscle became the straighter my body, so I was on a personal mission to push like my life depended on it. \n\n\nTl;Dr I ended up in the hospital because I couldn\u2019t give a shit and ended up spasming one of my back muscles. This was only remedied after days of trying to push some crap out with the help of medication. \n\nEdit from the toilet: It\u2019s kinda wild how many people have said they\u2019ve had a similar or the same problem. We all need to fix our diets. \n\nTo clarify, what proooobably did it was me eating Mini Wheats cereal every morning for breakfast, a single Nutella to go every lunch, and then whatever my mother made for dinner which tends to be high in protein, medium in carbs, and little fiber. I would also sneak a solid bowl or two after school of Mini Wheats for Second Lunch. Love me some Mini Wheats.  ", "reply": "After dropping a substantial deuce I feel very relaxed and satisfied.

{"listen": "The day before my parents went off to Bora Bora, they told my brother and I not to invite two of our closest friends over because when we got together we always got into some kind of trouble. Being the good boys that we were we promised them we would not invite our friends over. This was really the first time that my parents had left my brother and I alone at the house for more than a few days so they really had to put their faith in us.\n\nAfter several days of them being gone, I suddenly realized that they would have no clue if my friends came over while they were on such a remote island. I didn't have to tell them anything. While my brother was at work and I texted my friends and told them to come over to our house to wait for my brother to come home so that we could all do something together.\n\nI was halfway through the Dark Knight when my friends came over so we decided to finish that while we waited for my brother. My brother ended up getting a longer shift so in our boredom we decided we wanted to prank him when he got home. My friend suggested that we move everything in his room two inches to the left to see if that would mess with him. I then got the bright idea that not only should we do that, but we should move everything in the house two inches to the left.\n\nAfter one room of this prank, we decided it was lame so I came up with another idea. I told them, \"What if we flipped over everything in the house and made it look like the house got broken into so that my brother freaks out when he comes home.\" So we did just that. We turned over couches, beds, and chairs. We broke light bulbs on the ground. We even took all of the valuable items in the house and placed them in my truck and then drove it around the block. Honestly if we were trying to make a movie set of a house that got broken in to, we nailed it. I opened the garage half way to make it seem like someone had gotten in that way. I then turned off all of the lights and got out a super bright flashlight.\n\nI called my brother and told him that I would be staying with some family friends that night so he would have to hold down the fort himself. My plan was, when my bother opened the door I would shine my flashlight in his eyes and then would run out of the garage and he would see all of the damage in the house and freak out for a minute. Then I would tell him it was all a joke. That is not what happened.\n\nWhen my brother got home, he called me and asked me if I had left the garage door open. I told him maybe and that he should just shut it when he got inside. He got pretty spooked by the entire house being completely dark and did not go in right away like I thought he would. Then I accidentally turned on the flash light and he saw it. The moment he saw that he called the police and told them our house was being robbed.\n\nI called him and told him it was just a prank. He said he had already called the police. I said, \"Well Un-call them!\" but it was too late. My brother came in the house and we decided to clean the house up before they came so it looked like we were not robbing the place. We knew we were hosed when we saw the blue and red lights in front of our driveway. The officers came up to the door and knocked super loudly and said to come out with our hands up. We obeyed and then they told us to get on our knees in the front lawn. They told us that the guns they were pointing at us were loaded and that if we moved we would be shot.\n\nI was so scared that they would count the uncontrollable shaking of my body as moving. I told them, \"It was all a prank officer!\" and he yelled back, \"I don't give a fuck!\". He questioned us for about fifteen minutes with the gun on us while his partner searched the house. After awhile our neighbor came outside and screamed, \"No don't shoot those boys! They are good kids!\" They questioned her for awhile and finally told us that we were the stupidest fucking kids alive and that they never wanted to come back to our house again.\n\nWe thanked our neighbor for saving us and then went back to \"sleep\". Which really meant we were questioning every decision we have ever made. Definitely one of the dumbest things I have done in my life.\n\nTL;DR-Tried to play a prank on my brother by making it seem like their were thieves in my house when he got home from work. We flipped over everything in the house and took all of the valuable stuff in it. The cops were called and they put us on our knees in the front lawn and pointed guns at us for over fifteen minutes. Our neighbor came to save us. We realized we were the dumbest fucking kids alive.\n\nEDITS:\n1. Because this question has been asked alot: Yes my parents found out. We held off from telling them but eventually my neighbor told them. We obviously got in some pretty bad trouble but my parents could see how shaken up we were and we didnt die so they were not ruthless to us.\n\n2. I have seen that my writing is kind of confusing and makes it seem like my friends disappeared. For clarification it was me, my two friends, and my brother on the front lawn.

{"listen": "**THIS IS SUPER CLUTTERED AND IT STRESSES ME OUT SO I MADE A NEW POST FOR THE UPDATE:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9kuza2/tifu_by_spending_300_on_laundry_update/?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, I\u2019m a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. I grew up middle class with a very simple family. Right now, I\u2019m traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally I expected to do laundry at some point. I figured most Hilton\u2019s have guest laundry so this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \n\nAs I\u2019m checking in I ask the front desk, \u201cDo you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?\u201d \n\nHe goes on to tell me they don\u2019t have quarter laundry but their Hilton does have guest laundry. I\u2019d just leave my shit with him and they\u2019d have it done by that evening. \n\nMe, being the simpleton I am, thinks it\u2019s complimentary. To be fair, HE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT COST A LOT OF MONEY. I mean, based on my reaction alone, that should\u2019ve been some indicator that I was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. Christ, I just asked where the local laundromat was. Of course I don\u2019t have that sort of money. Plus, after he said that, I literally jerked my head back and was like, \u201cReally? How does that work?\u201d And proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how I never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. Not once did he mention cost. Even after I dropped off my huge bag of crumpled up laundry he didn\u2019t say a word. Hindsight, of course it cost money. But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. I figured most people didn\u2019t use the service since they typically just stayed at the hotel a night or two. It was probably used mostly by few people like me who traveled for work. Maybe I\u2019m dumb, but still. He should have mentioned a cost. \n\nSo I go about my day. Get back to the hotel. Get my laundry and thank the girl. The guy I had talked to before was gone now and it was a new person. As I\u2019m leaving she says, \u201cI\u2019ll just add the cost to your room.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m taken aback but it happens so fast that I just smile and nod and go to my room. The entire walk up I\u2019m replaying her words in my head. Cost? What cost? It wasn\u2019t until I got to my room that I started to panic. I raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. They charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! The real fucking kicker is that they didn\u2019t even wash nice clothes. Among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts, and my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. It was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. \n\nNow, I was raised to be polite, so I made sure to tell her I\u2019m not at all mad at her since it\u2019s not her fault, but WHAT THE FUCK???  I\u2019m proud to say I kept my composure the entire time, but I felt like crying. I still sort of do. She gave me the number to her manager, and I sent him an email yesterday afternoon. He works on Monday, so I\u2019m definitely going to stop in and see if there is ANYTHING they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. I travel a lot for work so I have a crap ton of Hilton honors points. Enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. I\u2019m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.* My job definitely doesn\u2019t cover that cost, and I most certainly don\u2019t have that kind of dough. Not sure what I\u2019m going to do. If anyone has any suggestions I\u2019d be grateful for help. Unless I\u2019m completely fucked.... \n\nTl;dr - I thought guest laundry was complimentary. It is, in fact, not. Got a $300 bill when I could\u2019ve just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry. \n\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThis isn't a super exciting update, but I thought I'd keep you all in the loop. I received an e-mail early this morning from one of the managers at Hilton in reply to the frantic e-mail I sent after the \"incident.\" She is \"happy to work with me on the balance\" but I don't quite know what this means yet as the e-mail was pretty vague. Could be anything from a full refund, to knocking ten dollars off, or a voucher, or something like that. She also asked me what amount I could pay towards the $300 bill. \n\nIn my head, I was like *\"uhhhh how bout free-fifty yo,\"* but I realized that getting away with paying a reduced rate is more than fair and she was super generous to even offer that. Realistically, if I can get this down to $50, I'd be happy. I mean, I'd be happy with anything at all, but 50 bones would allow me to rest easy at night. \n\nSo I decided to reply. \n\nI thought about it, and instead of listing a number I'd contribute toward the total, I chose to give her a more detailed account of what had happened. You see, email number one was written when I was tweaking out on adrenaline after this all originally transpired. I didn't do a good job of explaining how I was mislead, or how I didn't fill out any forms, and instead sounded like some frantic teenage girl who'd just gotten her first speeding ticket. So I pretty much shared the story that I did with you all, but spiffed it up with some grown-up words. At the end, I said something along the lines of, \"In regards to how much I can pay toward the $300 bill--I was prepared to spend $5 in quarters for my laundry that afternoon (haha). I'm willing to work with you on the price, but I am unable to spend anywhere near $300 for laundry.\"\n\nThat's good right?! I have no idea as I'm horrible at this sort of thing. I'm so bad at balancing politeness with sternness; I always lean toward to nice, so when I try to be stern I either am not stern enough or am like Winston from New Girl and take it too far. I hate complaining and causing problems!! But I hate being out $300 dollars more, so I bit the bullet. Anyway, I sent that e-mail maybe five hours ago. My original plan was to go to the hotel this afternoon and sort this out, but since I'd received that e-mail, I thought I'd hold off to see if we could solve it that way. If I don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I will definitely go down there after work. I held off because I felt like marching down there hours after getting an e-mail was a bit aggressive. I'm in Houston for the week (staying at a different hotel) so it's no trouble for me to make the trip.\n\nAnyway, that's what's up!! I'm hoping she just e-mails me this afternoon, and I can be done with all this drama. Shout out to all the Redditors who offered to help me pay the bill. That's insanely nice of you and it fills me with joy to know there are such kind strangers in this world. However, I could never accept payment from strangers for my own fuck up. \n\n\nThanks for all the support and advice!! I really appreciate it. \n\n\n", "reply": "Could u sell your Hotel points to someone for cash, or book a room for someone in exchange for cash? "}

You deserve a perfectly good pizza, let me call them and order a new one. You won't have to pay for anything\" and I was like \"No, it's fine honestly. It looks good to me\" and he kept insisting to call them to order a new one (for free). Eventually I agreed and he apologized for the 'ruined' pizza and left.

That\u2019s not how it works. You go out with someone you\u2019re attracted to/interested in, and continue to spend time with them until you come across a dealbreaker.

{"listen": "So I want to start by saying I bought a new ninja 400 this year. I did all the research into which bike I should get and watched all the youtube videos.\n\nI was told:\n\n- You will most likely drop your first bike\n- Don\u2019t buy a new one (see above)\n- Take the class\n- Respect the bike\n- Ride within your limits\n- Stay 600cc or preferably below\n\n500 miles in I had a low-speed (fortunately) low-side crash that broke the fantasy I was living in. Fortunately, I had basic gear (gloves, boots, helmet) or my left hand would be quite a bit thinner.\n\nThese were the lies I told myself:\n\n- I\u2019m a responsible driver therefore I will be a responsible rider\n- I won\u2019t drop my bike so I can buy a new one\n- I\u2019m smarter than these other guys so I can ride hard without road experience\n\nSo the message I would like new or prospective riders to take from this is, first of all, assume the advice here and everywhere else online applies to EVERYBODY. \n\nI drive my truck like an old woman on her way home from lunch on Sunday. But when I get on the bike I feel an irresistible urge that creeps in to go a little bit faster. The acceleration is a thrill more than the speed. If I can fall prey to it then so can you.\n\nAnd the biggest fallacy was that when I go fast it\u2019s not the same as when other people go fast because IM not an idiot. Well going 70 on narrow residential streets makes me an idiot. Like I said I wouldn\u2019t classify myself as a reckless person but you get stuck in traffic for a while and when you finally get out you WILL want to open it up. \n\nYou are the biggest threat to your own safety. And the best antidote to over-confidence is constant honest self-assessment.\n\nGood luck. Wear your gear.\n\nEdit: People seem to be taking issue with me admitting I\u2019ve done something reckless, and I\u2019m not going to defend it. It was reckless.

The more shell size the better the fit. Don't buy a helmet where a small and large share a shell size. If you are a small you will look like a bobblehead. Plus there will be extra weight on your head and neck. Third look for how many layers of EPS foam it has. Look two or more, but ideally, three layers or more is what you want. If the helmet doesn't say how many layers of foam it has don't buy it. fourth you want to look for the rating. Look for Snell or ECE or both. If it is Snell approved you can get on any race track. ECE is also great. Lastly, is the padding inside the helmet if it has padding the car be peeled away for a better fit it will be more conferable and fit your head better. \nI personally have a Scorpion EXO-R710 Helmet it's the cheapest fiberglass lid you can buy. The Scorpion EXO-R420 is also great and Snell rated but there are lots of other great lids out there. \n\nYes, Revzilla a reputable store.

{"listen": "The frustrating thing about this kind of video is that it sets the non-ABS bike up for failure by contriving a worst case scenario. This only reinforces the view that ABS is for clumsy newbies and doddering old fools who should just hang up their boots and buy a Camry.\n\nMotorcycling is full of riders who are convinced that they can out-brake an ABS. In ideal conditions maybe some of them can. When taken by surprise, maybe not so many, and the consequences of underperforming can be catastrophic.\n\nI don't know if this has been tested for motorcycles, but research into car drivers shows that a good majority consider themselves to be well above average in terms of driving skill/competency (clearly doesn't add up). Most likely riders are similar - therefore a better ABS vs non-ABS test should:\n- use a rider with established high competency/credibility, such as a professional racer\n- repeat tests in both ideal and challenging conditions\n\nMy guess is that under sufficient pressure, even a pro would fall without the ABS safety net. It would also be useful to see honest results of comparative braking distance, so that the perceived* merits of non-ABS could be fairly weighed against the drawbacks.\n\n*Standardised testing that I've read on bikes as old as 2002 found that ABS performed better on both wet and dry surfaces, even compared to best non-ABS results. However one can never get past the theoretical argument, and yes, manual hydraulic braking should be able to match or beat ABS (in theory).\n\nPersonally, I love my GTR with ABS and wouldn't go back to a street bike without it.", "reply": "Do the pro race bikes have ABS?

This would be mainly for heavy traffic relief on highways /freeways/motorways/carriageways/what have you.  As well as being able to move towards the front at traffic lights.  Everyone states that lane splitting at 15mph/25kph would be unsafe when highways are going 70 mph /110 kph, but we feel that that is not the time to be splitting, only when traffic is slow or stopped, hence the hard limit.\n\n\nCurrently the proposal is worded to keep any existing splitting/filtering laws as they are. \n\n\nYes I realize Californian is best in every way about this, I've got 30+ messages saying so.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, we need to make sure what we propose appeals to the whole population.  Convincing your grandmother (who probably votes more than you as well) to allow lane splitting/filtering will be easier at current write up where it's for use in stopped or almost stopped traffic will be easier than convincing her that you can lane split at 65 mph/100 kph.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext edit.

If you think you can make it, I highly suggest Mt.

It'll largely depend on where you rent from, but a majority of your 8 hours could easily be caught up slogging through traffic and stoplights, so if you're renting from 819, make sure your shop is on the outskirts somewhere rather than right downtown.\n\nThe Kii peninsula has a lot to offer, but 8 hours is a short time to spend there. If you think you can make it, I highly suggest Mt. Koya and the ancient temple complex there, as well as the extremely fun Ryujin-Koyasan skyline (route 371).\n\nWherever you end up going, spend some time with google street view, and avoid the prefectural routes (shown as yellow in google maps). Look for the smaller white roads which will keep you away from the more dense traffic.\n\nFeel free to PM me with your intended rental location, general experience with motorcycles, and anything else you think is relevant and I'll be able to go into a lot more detail.", "reply": "Never heard of /r/RideitJapan, will have to check that out! And I'm a bit ahead of ya, also cross posted on /r/JapanTravel (can't believe how detailed that sub is...).\n\nI was looking at bikes offered and picked from the shops list: a Rebel 250, Vulcan S, and MT-07. They responded with the Rebel so I thought maybe that's all they had. VTR250s does look fun, I was thinking a cruiser might facilitate scenic tourists a bit more.\n\nI was looking at 819, and had picked a shop in the Minato Ward, which, looks to be the opposite of the outskirts lol. Didn't know they had a lot of different shops. Will have to try and find a location a bit further out.\n\nI actually was looking at riding to Mt. Koya! We wanted to stay there overnight but it didn't fall in the cards to let us. \n\nYou seem to know a lot about riding in Japan, my one big question I suppose I have other than routes is how safe it is riding a motorcycle around? I have not opted to pick up travel health insurance and I'd much rather avoid going into steep debt from some fun. Thanks a ton for your response, helped a lot!"}

It's very safe compared to the US. Speed limits are ridiculously slow though (almost all roads are 50 kph or less), so that could take some time getting used to. You can get away with moderate speeding, but don't push it too much. I think your biggest surprise here will be how technical the roads are.\n\n&gt; I have not opted to pick up travel health insurance and I'd much rather avoid going into steep debt from some fun.\n\nAs for any rental anywhere, it will come with insurance which will include medical care. At 819, it's very reasonable per day.\n\nI also suggest looking into OSMAnd (or OSMios for iPhone) for routing your ride. Google maps can't be downloaded and used offline in Japan due to some kind of corporate legal thing. Google maps also tends to reroute you to the major roads, and towards the traffic. I only use it for point A to point B navigation. OSM is free, you can download the maps so it works offline, and it can be quickly programmed with a specific route. I suggest downloading it and spending some time learning how to use it before you come here, so you're familiar with it before you have to rely on it."}

Who knows - if your question is deemed to be helpful it may be added to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_good_starter_bike.3F) (which you should read)!\n\n***\n\nThis thread will be refreshed each Monday.\n\n\n[Previous Threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/search?q=flair%3A%22SUPERTHREAD%22&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n", "reply": "I've put a couple years and thousands of miles into my first motorcycle, a 2003 KLR 650.

I bought my Vstrom with ~22000 miles on it, have put on nearly another 22000, but have not yet needed new chain, sprockets, or brake pads.  Some of that is down to proper chain maintenance, some to the fact it isn't a crotch rocket with a super powerful engine and I don't ride like a jackass (usually :).\n\nTires are just as with any other motorcycle - some last longer than others, and you're very doing well to get 10000+ miles out of a rear tire.\n\nThe DL1000 engine is very reliable.  I had my valve clearance checked at about 37000 miles, and it was spot-on.  Hadn't changed a bit since the last valve clearance check (around 15000 miles).\n\nThe major pain in the ass has been electrical issues.  By that I mean, charging system problems.  My 2007 DL1000 was (probably) on its original stator when I bought the bike at about 22000 miles.  By ~25000 miles, the stator was burned out.  Rotor magnets had also shifted out of position.\n\nLong story short, I ended up replacing/repairing/upgrading the entire charging system, from stator to battery.  I also installed a charging voltage meter, so I can tell if there's a problem before I get stranded (this is just basic eqiupment for any bike IMO).  Haven't had any charging problems for about a year/the last 12000 miles.\n\nI'm probably making it sound worse than it is.  The charging system was a larger issue for the first few generations of DL1000 and DL650.  Some Vstrom owners never had a problem.  All this has been dealt with, through design revisions and recalls, in newer generations of Vstrom (roughly 2010-present).  The guys with recent-model DL1000/DL650's don't seem to have charging issues.  If it's just a few years old, you should be OK (but install a voltage meter anyway!).\n\nI've had to replace both of my radiator hoses (inlet and outlet).  At over 10 years old, they had lost their elasticity and were leaking slightly.  Under $20 each.  Easy to replace, not a big deal.\n\nAs for replacement parts: in general they're affordable, about on par with any other Japanese bike.  Suzuki does not seem to go out of their way to gouge you.  You can often find used parts on eBay, if you're on a budget.\n\nSome of the more-commonly-broken controls: $40-$70 each for things like the clutch &amp; brake levers, shift lever, rear brake pedal, anything you're likely to break off or damage in a drop/low-speed crash.  All of which I have done at least once, except for the brake lever.\n\nYou can also do a cheap fix with a Lever Saver.  Not as pretty as a pristine factory clutch lever, but much cheaper.\n\nGet crash bars (aka \"engine guard\"), whether you plan to ride unpaved roads or not.  These prevent a lot of damage when you drop the bike (and you almost inevitably will!).\n\nIf you do plan to go on dirt, get a skid plate as well.  \n\nThose two things will pay for themselves, eventually.\n\nSeat height: It's rather tall, in the neighborhood of 31\", depending on year and aftermarket seats.  So that should be fine for you.\n\nLuggage: My Vstrom came with Givi/Kappa Monokey side and top cases.  I like the Givi Monokey system, because replacement parts are fairly cheap and easy to replace.  For example, I replaced all 3 locks (so they could all use the same key) for around $30.  I've mangled both of my side cases in offroad shenanigans, yet repaired them for about $20 each time.\n\nWindshield: California Scientific makes an extra tall windshield for Vstroms.  Being a taller dude,you may want this.  I'm 6'2\" and I just got their \"XL\" Vstrom windshield.  It's sooooo nice on the highway.  I can sit up straight, see over the top of the windshield, and yet not have a face full of buffetting.\n\nLots more info is at the Stromtrooper forums (http://stromtrooper.com/).  There are specific sub-forums for different model years, so you can do more research when you find a used Vstrom on Craigslist etc.\n\nHope this helps!"}

Pirelli Angel GT and Michelin Pilot Road (specifically. Pilot Power will give you more dry grip, but won't last nearly as long).\n\n&gt; Should I replace them myself?\n\nIf you're asking this, the answer is probably no.

That bad reputation comes from the years when AMF owned the brand and tried to ramp up production faster than quality control could keep up with. AMF sold HD in 1981. You should also watch out for bikes made before 2001 that use Magneti Marelli's EFI system, as those are prone to failure.

{"listen": "Edit: I don't know how anyone can misunderstand a principle this badly, but of course I'm saying in addition to using your front brakes, goof balls. \n\n\nJust saw a post where everyone seemed to agree that if your front brakes are powerful, I. E. sport bikes with dual rotors, you're good to go with just front brakes, because they're good enough to pick the rear up, so what benefit would using the rear add?\n\nHere's why you NEED to use your rear brake every time your bike slows down:\n\n1. Using your rear brake keeps the bike upright. This means whenever you trail the rear brake into a turn, the bike will have a steady force pulling from the back end of the bike that will stabilize the rear. Even a tiny amount of pressure, not enough to slow you down, will give you a much smoother turn in every time.\n\n1.a This is especially important in parking lots and slippery surfaces, your bike will be much more resistant to your weight movement and will be steered by the bars more, giving you a more predictable route and a more vertical bike, which is the end goal of all body lean in the first place. Any movement you do on the bike, whether it's leaning off or sitting forward or back during acceleration/deceleration, it's always to achieve the goal of keeping the bike more upright and aligned, and thus stable.\n\n2. Your rear brake keeps your bike from diving and bouncing forward and back. When you initially grab front brakes, your weight will cause the forks to compress, and in virtually all cases you'll have a slight bounce back after the fork reaches compression because of how springs work. Your rear brake, in combination with your swing arm angle, will keep your swing arm in a limited range of motion as long as the brake is applied. To test this, stop with a decent amount of rear brake, and hold the brake until you're stopped. Let go of the rear, and your bike will kick up an inch or two as the swingarm returns to its natural position. This also means that as you hit the fronts, just the act of keeping the swing arm in a limited range will keep the front end from diving and bouncing as much, letting you brake much harder even if the front is doing 95% of the stopping.\n\n3. It will smooth out your engine braking, when you're doing so just lightly apply the rear brake, especially in between gears, and the bike will feel much more predictable\n\n4. It will help keep you from lowsiding. In addition to all of the above, if you do happen to start losing your front, the rear tire being braked will serve to straighten out the bike, like a spinning car that suddenly locks the e-brake. It won't save you by itself, but it will keep the bike more upright and in a predictable corner arc, which can help in some situations where the front loses grip.\n\n5. Fish tailing the rear as you stop sometimes happens when you hit oil or shitty pavement anyways, so if you can get a good feel for when the rear locks up and how it handles, it will make that situation fun instead of terrifying.\n\n6. Your bike is trying to fall at all times. If you're turning and aren't on the throttle, you need to be on the brakes, to keep the bike from wobbling and picking a side to fall on. To test this out go to a parking lot and make tighter and tighter turns, within about 20 feet, and see how stable the bike is once you're off the gas. You won't be able to keep it on the same line without the throttle as you lose momentum and stability. With a little rear brake AND throttle, you'll be able to make tighter and tighter stable circles. Just don't blame me if you crash! \n\n7. There's no excuse for lazy riding. If you're the type of person who reads reddit motorcycle tips like this in the first place, just take the effort and do it right, your bike will feel completely different and you'll have much more confidence in the course your bike takes through any kind of corner or braking situation.\n\nTldr watch twist of the wrist and try things out on your bike to see what does what", "reply": "And yet this all is obviously wrong in straight-line braking.

Anyway, I've been dating my boyfriend for about 3 years. We have had major ups and downs due to my self esteem issues, especially with my breasts. They aren't super small, but they aren't giant and they are definitely not perky. They are what I would classify as tuberous. He has said a ridiculous amount of times that he loves them, but there was one moment a few months ago where he did say he wished they were bigger and rounder. \n\nAnyway, I have jokingly brought up him watching porn. He says he doesn't need to anymore or that he's not tempted, etc. He has said this multiple times.\n\nI know I shouldn't have, and I know it's a bad sign, but he left his phone on the coffee table tonight. Old habits die hard. I went into his Google search history and it turns out, he has been watching porn videos every single day for the past couple of months. Not just one or two videos, at least five or six at a minimum. His porm searches and / or choices of videos also center on what I don't have - \"ie massive tits, huge tits, ebony (I'm white), etc\".  It makes it even worse that we just moved in together 2 months ago. It took so much for me to move in with him, because of my past. I was absolutely terrified of being hurt and moving in with someone does not make that any less likely. \n\nAnyway, I brought it up to him tonight and he completely brushed off like it was nothing, saying when did I ever say I didn't watch porn? I was definitely upset, visibly so and crying hard. He also searched for a local strip club within the past month. I asked him about that and of course he has no recollection of it. It's less the fact the porn he's watching (honestly, I've given up on trying to find a guy that is not obsessed with porn these days), and more about him lying to me and continuing to try to justify it all even after I bring it up. \n\nHow do I move forward with this?

The grocery store was to my back and I heard the gun sounds coming from behind me, I dropped my bag holding my cans of tomatoes and other canned goods and left the rest of my groceries as I scurried into my vehicle as I grabbed my purse. \nIt\u2019s a Sunday so it\u2019s very packed and the parking lot had about 10-12 people in my aisle walking and they quickly turned around with some people fast walking at first and then running quickly. I saw a mom out the corner of my eye leave her cart of groceries as well and run to her vehicle just as I did. It was terrifying. There was about 20-30 gunshots within a minute I thought the grocery store was getting shot up and I presume that\u2019s what the other people thought as they ran away in fear.

I didn\u2019t want to leave my car but I did and left the food in my car and locked the car and my house and grabbed my gun and ran upstairs and locked my bedroom door. I know this sounds crazy but I was so nervous because I live so close and was still in fear. I turned on my police scanner (it\u2019s an app on my phone) and about 20 minutes later they reported that a few males were doing target practice directly in back of the grocery store!! What the hell!! Why would you put people in terror by doing that!! They were shooting right in back of the building it sounded like the shots were coming from the inside of the store or the parking lot so we all ran away in fear. I feel like an idiot for running for nothing, wasting my money, and looking like a fool. I hope no one got hurt when they ran away there was quite a few elderly individuals. I was terrified. My husband called me when I was in the room and said he was proud of me and said \u201cyou did everything right\u201d but I feel so silly!
